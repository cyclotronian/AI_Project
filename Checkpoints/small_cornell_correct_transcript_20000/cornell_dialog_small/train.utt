well ,  gregor and i will look forward to seeing you . 
yes ,  i think so .  just about then .

well ,  i &apos;ll tell you why i ask .  you see ,  i &apos;ve got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i haven &apos;t been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so ,  and with all these stories one hears ,  i &apos;m a little concerned about her .

may i try it ? 
well ,  i &apos;m glad to hear that . 
i &apos;m sure there is a way ,  majesty .  some kind of a little contest .  i could perhaps put together a small committee ,  and i could see to it naturally that it will select according to your majesty &apos;s wishes . 
your majesty ! 
why so ? 
guess !  guess ,  majesty .  imagine the longest time such a thing could last ,  then double it . 
ah - ha .  well then ,  we should make some effort to acquire him .  we could use a good german composer in vienna ,  surely ?

mio caro adone . 
herr mozart ,  what brings you here ?

wolfgang ,  what is it ?  sta calmo ,  per favore .  what &apos;s the matter ?

a man who deserved a requiem mass and never got one . 
what happened ?  is it over ? 
shall i answer it ? 
who ? 
so now the confutatis .  confutatis maledictis .  when the wicked are confounded .  flammis acribus addictis .  how would you translate that ?

mozart  - 
what do you want ? 
i can &apos;t say i do .  what is it ? 
yes ,  father .  yes !  so much for my vow of chastity .  what did it matter ?  good ,  patient ,  hard - working ,  chaste  -  what did it matter ?  had goodness made me a good composer ?  i realized it absolutely then  -  that moment :  goodness is nothing in the furnace of art .  and i was nothing to god . 
no ,  you didn &apos;t ! 
oh my son ,  my poor son ! 
you mean that play ? 
what anger ? 
yes ,  absolutely .  is there a ballet in figaro ? 
well ,  actually ,  sire ,  if you remember ,  we did finally incline to italian . 
here i am ,  my angel . 
i &apos;ll call tomorrow .

nurse hobbs said there &apos;s a disturbance in leicester square involving some sort of mad dog . 
you put me in an awkward position ,  mr .  kessler . 
let &apos;s try a little harder ,  shall we ? 
i &apos;m sorry .  i shouldn &apos;t have asked you . 
david ,  your dreams will stop .  you &apos;ll leave england and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away . 
now ,  david ,  i said i would keep you company ,  but i meant right here and now . 
how did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient ? 
you &apos;re being awfully forward ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
all i am to you is a sex fantasy then ? 
listen ,  if you get too anxious ,  call me at the hospital ,  okay ? 
david ,  please be rational .  let &apos;s go to dr .  hirsch . 
we had an argument .  he &apos;s being silly . 
hopeless .  it &apos;s hopeless . 
leave me alone ,  dammit !  you people are crazy !  i &apos;ve got to get away from here !  i &apos;ve got to do something ! 
officer ,  i killed those people last night . 
that &apos;s easy for you to say  -  you &apos;re already dead . 
two weeks ? 
you &apos;ve never had bad dreams before ? 
i really don &apos;t know . 
rendezvous in rome starring jack goodman and debbie klein .  the love affair that shocked europe !  see torrid lovemaking at its most explicit !  see jack and debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the vatican !  never has the screen dared .  .  . 
that &apos;s not a spear .  it &apos;s a pike . 
okay . 
jack ,  we &apos;d better go . 
that was weird .  i guess leaving was the best idea . 
what do you think was wrong ? 
come on ,  where ? 
thanks a lot . 
i &apos;m sorry to be upsetting you ,  david ,  but i had to come . 
listen to me !  take your own life ,  david .  it &apos;s our only chance . 
the supernatural !  the powers of darkness !  it &apos;s all true .  take your own life !  suicide ,  david .  join me . 
i didn &apos;t mean it .  i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m saying .  i &apos;m not even sure it was me who killed those people .  i don &apos;t remember doing it . 
david kessler ,  this is gerald bringsly . 
dr .  hirsch ? 
no ,  thank you ,  doctor . 
the forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved ,  that &apos;s true ,  but i hardly think .  .  . 
what can we do to assist you ? 
remember the alamo ? 
he may have a point ,  lieutenant .  two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man . 
i cannot accept a connection between david kessler and last night &apos;s murders .  we will find him ,  however .  i can assure you of that . 
tom ,  i never had trouble getting credit from you before .  when i was flat broke you gave me all the money i wanted .  now i come to you with a swell deal ,  and the greatest
oscar ,  what &apos;s the matter ? 
no kidding ? 
yeah .  he &apos;ll have a tough time thinking up a wise - crack for this one  .   .   . 
he has ? 
say ,  do me a favor ,  will you charlie ? 
whose death ? 
where you been ? 
i remember once when your account checked . 
and listen ,  wise guy  -  i &apos;m setting friend time clock for exactly nine o &apos;clock ,  so no squawks out of you guys in the morning . 
personally ,  i think you &apos;re getting panic - stricken about nothing .  dickson &apos;s all right . 
we want to talk to you . 
i know that among you ,  you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city .  get that money over here and i &apos;ll stop this run within five minutes . 
no .  you can &apos;t reason with anyone else when you &apos;re in a jam .  we pleaded with you to keep liquid ,  but you wouldn &apos;t listen to us .  you preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish .  now you want our help .  you want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you &apos;ve wrecked .  all right .  there &apos;s one way you can get it .  give us an option on your stock and resign as president . 
i hope you don &apos;t mind me asking you a few questions ,  mr .  cluett . 
looks like you &apos;re going to have no trouble at all .  what was the lady &apos;s name ,  mr .  cluett ? 
oh ! 
don &apos;t be a fool ,  cluett .  this is only going to make it worse for you . 
confessed !  cluett ,  in heaven &apos;s name ,  what got into you ? 
fifty thousand dollars ! 
then what did you want to gamble for ?  if you &apos;d have beat us out of fifty g &apos;s ,  you &apos;d have been paid ,  wouldn &apos;t you ?  well ,  we want our dough . 
that don &apos;t do us any good . 
for a celebrated bounder ,  that is an awful admission .  besides ,  i never knew that any female could do this to you  . 
come on cyril ,  try a little bit of it out on me .  i haven &apos;t had any first - class blarney thrown at me since the day i was married . 
but i &apos;m giving a party for him  -  a real ,  old - fashioned surprise party .  caps ,  bells ,  whistles ,  and everything .  i &apos;m really terribly excited about it .  i &apos;ve been planning it for months . 
no .  no ,  i &apos;m afraid papa isn &apos;t that much interested .  he &apos;s too busy rushing off to philadelphia to make stuffy ,  old speeches at stuffy ,  old bankers &apos; meetings .  too busy closing big ,  important deals  i think i will have a drink . 
you know ,  there ought to be a congressional medal for men like you .  america &apos;s comfort to misunderstood wives .  i never thought i would find myself in that class . 
and now fair woman ,  i have you in my power . 
are the payrolls ready for tomorrow ? 
much better this morning ,  thank you . 
what &apos;s the matter dear ?  what have i done now ? 
i don &apos;t care whether it &apos;s important or not .  you said you were going out with me ,  and if you hadn &apos;t promised so faithfully ,  i wouldn &apos;t have gone and planned the whole thing . 
don &apos;t you forget that i &apos;m still the head man around here too .  now we &apos;ll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night .  you and i are going out together .  how &apos;s that ? 
all right .  i &apos;ll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night . 
come on in here ,  helen .  bring your book .  i want some numbers to try to get some action .  get parker at the union - leeds  -  the exchange  .   .   .  winslow and old man harris at the home mortgage .  snap into it ,  helen .  just as quick as you can . 
good morning ,  helen . 
yes ? 
helen ! 
you &apos;re not giving up ,  are you ,  mr .  dickson ? 
i want you both to take the day off .  go downtown and get a license and get married right away ! 
all i know is the bank &apos;s been robbed and a murder &apos;s been committed .  the way i see it ,  brown here looks guilty . 
that &apos;s just exactly what he has been doing .  this deal should have been closed weeks ago .  tell him to keep tomorrow open  .   .   . 
the big guys have got the screws on him .  you &apos;ve got to come through for him ,  mr .  conway .  he came through for you a hundred times .  if his friends don &apos;t help him ,  who is going to help him ? 
never mind all that .  what did you find out ? 
dude finlay ? 
what time did matt brown get in ? 
then who changed it ? 
eleven o &apos;clock ,  eh ?  are you sure it was that ? 
how are you fixed ? 
you can ride like that ? 
our place ,  clell miller &apos;s ,  sammy johnston ,  the creeders .  will hite . 
uhh ,  yeah it does . 
we got a problem here ,  brother ? 
this is the best score yet . 
that was because of .  .  .  the reputation the gang had . 
bob .  i didn &apos;t .  .  . 
my plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine ,  thank you . 
jesus mercy ,  that &apos;s charlie higgins ,  dave laller  .  .  . 
listen ,  he &apos;s my brother and i don &apos;t want to start trouble .  .  . 
you shut up now ,  boy . 
not now . 
this is your fault for hogging all the publicity . 
smells funny ,  it being mentioned in the paper . 
and almost got hanged in peacetime . 
we &apos;ll make them pay for this . 
missed you ,  cousin . 
the safe .  now . 
then why can &apos;t i go in there ? 
web died fighting ? 
they &apos;re gone .  what are you  -  - 
well ,  i hope the boy pulls through .  we should know in the morning . 
so you &apos;re saying i could have done more to attract their attention . 
such as ? 
all we thought about was coming home .  i swore i &apos;d kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again .  if i have to go to war with the railroad to stay ,  fine by me . 
you are a charmer . 
you ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming ? 
pardon the delay ,  folks ,  but we had to get mad bob younger under control ! 
what do you want me to say ,  frank ?  i was killing men when i was fifteen .  i like getting shot at .  i like riding out of town with a posse at my back .  this is a helluva better life than farming . 
they &apos;re all pinned down .  can &apos;t even get to the door . 
y &apos;know ,  uncle frank .  .  . 
how much of that story is true ? 
riders  -  - 
zerelda ?  little zee mimms ? 
but still died . 
jesse ,  are you awake ? 
you shouldn &apos;t be up . 
teasing you is completely unfair . 
i shouldn &apos;t tease a hero . 
mostly .  it would be an all right life ,  for a bachelor . 
are you going to be happy here ,  mr .  james ?  without all that excitement ? 
hmm . 
that &apos;s what i would have done . 
you cocky little bastard . 
that was for my ma .  now this is for everybody else . 
the lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable .    &quot; jesse woodson james .  &quot;  jesse james ?  the jesse james ? 
what about that rock island bastard ? 
jesse ,  you explain to lyla .  my girl ,  you know ,  from that time .  .  . 
why ,  yeah . 
really ! 
you see the army leaving and you see the loss of a tool .  i see a power void to be filled .  as we have the most power ,  we may move with impunity . 
to be precise ,  they didn &apos;t blow up the tracks . 
you wouldn &apos;t have done that ? 
 &quot; the gang made off with thirty - five thousand dollars and also destroyed the thaxton switch construction ,  meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land !  &quot;   who wrote this !  ?  i &apos;ll see him hanged every tuesday for a month ! 
pinkerton .  it &apos;s been eight months .  i see robberies .  i see hold ups .  but i do not see men on the end of nooses .

well ,  i mean ,  um ,  it s really .  .  . bosco .  you know ,  like .  .  .  like a dove bar .  it &apos;s a dove bar .  .  . hershey &apos;s syrup ? 
hubert &apos;s ?  oh really ?  it moved uptown ,  right ? 
she &apos;s my .  .  . cousin . 
nice .  very nice . 
how well did you know him ? 
i know it sounds like a lame question ,  but in new jersey i know this sounds like a lame question ,  but last month - i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard about this ,  but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts - 
nothing . 
you &apos;ll have to excuse me .  i have a lunch meeting with cliff huxtable at four seasons in twenty minutes . 
i actually came to see timothy price ,  but he &apos;s taken a leave of absence . 
i had a date with a girl named veronica . 
well .  .  . i .  .  . wait .  .  . what information have you received ? 
no ,  i like music .  just - they &apos;re - huey &apos;s too .  .  .  black sounding .  for me . 
so ,  the night he disappeared ?  any new thoughts on what you did ? 
i think maybe you &apos;ve got your dates mixed up . 
i &apos;ve questioned him . 
oh .  kimball now where were you ?  
i lost my job .  .  . 
listen ,  what &apos;s your name ? 
is that a raincoat ? 
you think so ? 
when i was a kid ?  and he was moving us all over the place ?  i spent all my time writing stuff on outpost 1 . 0 .  i thought gary boyd was the greatest . 
 .  .  . but ? 
when &apos;s brian coming for the tv ? 
are you saying you think they had something to do with his death ?  nelson said it was an airtight case . 
they hack into people &apos;s programs ? 
it isn &apos;t a broadcast studio .  it &apos;s  -  -  a surveillance post or something .  that &apos;s why they have the dishes on top . 
they stop the construction work at six or seven .  the parking lot &apos;s mostly clear by two or three in the morning .  even the early geeks don &apos;t get there before five . 
after i broke into 21  -  -  which was insane ,  thank god they didn &apos;t catch me !   -  -  i just drove around .  trying to figure out what possessed me .  you know what ?  i &apos;ve been putting my own guilt on gary . 
where were you ?   you know you can &apos;t keep anything from me . 
why doesn &apos;t he ask us to his party .  he &apos;s never even met you . 
beggar .  we &apos;re at a disadvantage with outpost .  our experts aren &apos;t as smart as theirs .  sometimes we can &apos;t tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly .  we need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights .  i &apos;m taking a shot in the dark ,  here .  i can offer you 32 , 000 a year ,  a buick .  i &apos;m hoping you &apos;ve got a feeling it &apos;s the right thing to do . 
milo ? 
milo ? 
and outpost ?  you &apos;re happy there ? 
what ?  ! 
milo ?  i &apos;m danny . 
we could move  &apos;em up here . 
 .  .  . hello ? 
the content filer has t &apos;be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms .  really ,  omniplatforms .  including whatever new hardware emerges . 
you really wrote this just today ? 
everything i do is under scrutiny .  the questions they ask ,  trying to make anything strategic look sordid .   i &apos;m confused .  doesn &apos;t everybody in business try to get ahead ? 
did you ? 
been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler .  and it came over me :  it &apos;s in the wrong place . 
that &apos;s great !  thanks . 
 &quot; dear lisa .  i &apos;ve enjoyed working with you .  i &apos;d be lying if i didn &apos;t say i find you attractive .  but in my heart i know that alice .  .  .  &quot;   you left my party to send e - mail ? 
gary ,  i  -  - 
help me change the skywire settings .  add five degrees to each satellite coordinate . 
gary ? 
just thought his work should go on . 
 .  .  . you wanna work  -  -  here ? 
could it be a glitch ?  something the construction workers caused ? 
me too !  were you an army brat or something ? 
mine &apos;s not the ceo .  he barely remembers to take a shower . 
so ,  when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers .  was that then ?  or now ? 
the mainstream media .  tv ,  or a newsmagazine . 
time ? 
gary knows i &apos;m close on skywire .  we have to do this fast . 
they know ,  i had no choice .  get out of the house now !  do you have a laptop ? 
bring it to the other location . 
is that how larry feels ? 
they &apos;re in the neighborhood .  they usually hassle vietnamese grocers . 
did you tell alice ? 
i dunno .  i guess larry &apos;s got me totally suspicious of that place . 
every geek here &apos;s got a thing for lisa .  but that &apos;s about the biggest reaction she &apos;s had to anybody . 
what is it ? 
who &apos;re these guys ? 
what ,  and watch all my earnings go .  .  .   down the toilet ? 
call me ritchie ,  miss fagina .  may i call you alotta .  .  .   please ? 
hello ,  austin .  this is basil exposition ,  chief of british intelligence .   you &apos;re austin powers ,  international man of mystery ,  and you &apos;re with agent mrs .  kensington .  the year is 1967 ,  and you &apos;re talking on a picture phone . 
thank you . 
yes ? 
thank god .  those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people ,  hey comrades ? 
vanessa &apos;s one of our top agents . 
be careful . 
oh ,  yes .  thank you . 
thank you ,  exposition .  only two things ,  scare me ,  and one is nuclear war .

but ,  wait ,  i -  -  you got me again .  oh ,  and austin -  - 
good afternoon ,  mr .  powers ,  i &apos;m the destructacon 5000 .  i &apos;m programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point .  you might as well surrender .  resistance is futile .  your odds of survival are 23 , 763 , 273 to .  .  . 
it seems the tables have turned again ,  dr .  evil . 
mr .  powers ,  my job is to acclimate you to the nineties .  you know ,  a lot &apos;s changed since 1967 . 
do i make you horny ? 
you &apos;ve preserved my jag !  smashing ! 
unfortunately ,  while you told that stupid story ,  dr .  evil has escaped . 
i haven &apos;t had fun like that since college . 
oh ,  yes you are . 
i can &apos;t believe you made love to her just like that .  did you use protection ? 
no ,  did you use a condom ? 
all right ,  i get it .  i have bad teeth .  you have to understand ,  in britain in the sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth .  it didn &apos;t matter . 
it &apos;s a shame he wasn &apos;t more headstrong . 
austin ,  i &apos;m coming with you . 
it says here ,  name danger powers . 
one warranty card for swedish - made penis enlarger pump ,  filled out by austin powers . 
hi ,  folks .  you &apos;re entering a restricted zone .  can i see your security badges ? 
everything seems to be in order . 
but my design was perfect !   your autonomic functions were shut down ,  and even though your arm wasn &apos;t frozen ,  the aging was retarded ,  therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left . 
ahhhhhhhhh ! 
austin powers is getting too close .  he must be neutralized .  any suggestions ? 
i have one simple request -  -  sharks with friggin &apos; laser beams attached to their heads ,  and it can &apos;t be done ?  remind me again why i pay you people ?  what do we have ? 
right . 
an evil petting zoo ? 
fine .  whatever .  mutated ,  ill - tempered sea bass it is .   come ,  let &apos;s return to dinner .  close the tank . 
did you ever .  .  . 
you didn &apos;t answer my question ,  mum . 
and how do you feel about that ? 
as real as you wish .  hot or cold .  humid or dry .  anything you like .  within reason . 
i want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when i say these words .  do you understand  .  .  .   ?   blue  .  .  . 
nature  .  .  . 
secret  .  .  . 
hope .  .  . 
how long have i been here ? 
you
ah ,  beautiful .  just as he promised . 
you are female ? 
quite a collection .

london .  the world council of ministers meets soon on global defence .  if you can control the weather ,  you control the world . 
about your next assignment ,  mrs .  peel  .  .  . 
ahem .  as i was saying ,  perhaps another macaroon  .  .  . 
an unholy trinity  .  .  . 
such as ? 
choices ? 
red herring would have been too obvious ,  don &apos;t you think ? 
i didn &apos;t .  mother did . 
steed ,  we really must be  -  - 
and i suppose you &apos;re the knight . 
the family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined . 
for you ,  mrs .  peel . 
three agents killed by bad weather .  .  . 
do you always drive this fast ? 
someone didn &apos;t want us to get to the party . 
you followed me . 
drat .  someone wants to implicate you in this affair ,  mrs .  peel .  any idea who ? 
mrs .  peel ? 
i don &apos;t recall siberia being this warm ,  steed . 
i was getting to it . 
very good ,  mrs .  peel  .  .  . 
your research into climate engineering was state - of - the - art .  your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming  -  -  had they succeeded .  we need your expertise . 
something went wrong .  system malfunction .  explosion .  mrs .  peel had a narrow escape .  suspected sabotage .  nothing proven .  file still open . 
you &apos;re accusing mrs .  peel of killing her own husband ? 
i &apos;m going to follow up on a hunch of my own .  if i &apos;m right ,  mrs .  peel is innocent and you have a mole . 
you with mother or father ? 
wonderland weather ltd . 
mrs .  peel  -  -   ? 
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to find out .  .  . 
i &apos;m glad you guys came by .  .  .  what &apos;s the occasion ? 
i don &apos;t get it ,  but at least gary &apos;s got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes . 
man ,  you &apos;re losing your audience . 
okay ,  ten thousand plus a g . e .  toaster oven ,  a litton microwave ,  a cuisinart .  .  . 
some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise . 
cole ? 
cole ,  i &apos;m marrying rick . 
huh ?  wha .  .  . 
the wedding ,  my parents ,  your family ,  our friends ,  my job ,  the future ,  our relationship ,  the caterers ,  my gown ,  your tuxedo ,  our honeymoon ,  the apartment ,  my shower ,  your bachelor party .  .  . 
well .  .  .  twenty - four more hours to go and tonight we &apos;ll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness . 
let go of me ! 
i don &apos;t believe you . 
see ?  and these are not just ordinary party - goers  -  -  there are professionals in this crowd  -  -  i didn &apos;t want any of them .  you .  .  .  you &apos;re what i want .  understand ? 
what kind of job ?  i &apos;m a housewife . 
great bathing suit . 
your whores never showed up . 
hookers beat you up ? 
big problem now .  soon they go to customers . 
is that all the coke in the place ? 
she hates me .  it &apos;s over .  you &apos;ll see ,  as soon as you get married ,  everything changes .  you sure you want to go through with it ,  man ? 
i just want to be alone . 
lar .  .  .  sometimes when people are mad they say things they don &apos;t mean . 
you okay ? 
what the hell are you doing ? 
well ,  i have to admit my game &apos;s a little rusty ,  but i love polo .  it &apos;s unrelenting ,  a constant challenge to the senses .  really a beautiful experience . 
i &apos;d love that . 
er .  .  .  perhaps we ought to stop now . 
excuse me ,  but this is as arousing as a stroll through the vatican . 
don &apos;t you love it when old friends stop by ? 
what the hell is that ? 
under the table ! 
how &apos;d it go ? 
what &apos;s this ? 
now ,  don &apos;t get into any trouble . 
hey ,  you guys .  .  . 
what are you going to do about it ? 
nah ,  that &apos;s okay .  my brother has to look up old people &apos;s asses all day long .  let &apos;s give him a break . 
how the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside ? 
it &apos;s gonna flash ,  stevie .  we gotta get behind it .

oh god ,  stephen ,  what &apos;s going on with you ? 
 -  -  stephen ,  wait a minute .  i gotta talk to you .  it &apos;s adcox ,  he &apos;s  -  - 
let me tell you something .  martin swayzak is going to be this town &apos;s next mayor . 
what was that ?  oh man ,  you have picked up a few moves since john paul ii boulevard . 
you think that &apos;s really any of your business ? 
no ,  he &apos;s more of a dinosaur .  guy &apos;s not a dummy ,  though .  he &apos;s juggling alot of balls on this one . 
will you please keep your voice down ,  there &apos;s people  -  - 
oh yeah ,  he &apos;s the real fireman .   who are you ?  just another probie working for swayzak  -  - 
brian mccaffrey .  .  .   oh this is really a treat .  brian mccaffrey .  lost a dad to the animal ,  huh ?

 -  -  go to the bottom .  under heat properties . 
i got it after we talked to ronald .  torches .  want to fry the whole goddamn world .  but the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much .   -  -  the burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls .  and he made his burns backdrafts .  
in a word ,  brian ,  what is this job all about ? 
so seagrave and holcomb were accountants .  .  . 
this is the copy of swayzak &apos;s manning report that was released .  everybody on this job knows it &apos;s bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers .  they &apos;re all airtight . 
mr .  mccaffrey .  .  . 
well ,  if it isn &apos;t the littlest mccaffrey .   hey !  you break anything with that you buy it !   sorry ,  there must be something wrong with my eyes .  i keep thinking that &apos;s a fire department uniform .

what &apos;s wrong with him ? 
why they gotta make my nose so big ? 
you &apos;re in this up till ya neck . 
no offense . 
we got evicted from our home .  we &apos;ve both been on the streets for the last week . 
my tap shoes . 
what do i have to do ? 
how different ? 
dela ,  i &apos;m aboard .   as long as i get to hoof and get paid too !  !  ! 
mantan ? 
our guest today is pierre delacroix .  he is the creator of the highly controversial tv show mantan .  let &apos;s get right into it .   you have been called by some in the community a traitor ,  a sellout ,  an uncle tom .  why does your show generate such feelings ? 
do you know what c . p .  time is ? 
the material you &apos;ve been creating is too white bread .   white people with black faces .   the huxtable &apos;s ,  cosby ,  revolutionary .   but that &apos;s dead .   we can &apos;t go down that road again . 
we &apos;re all happy to be here and i &apos;m going to paint a picture for you . 
i &apos;ve done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right .   in my previous work it &apos;s been all surface ,  superficial .   i have never really dug deep .   not anymore .   as mark twain fully understood satire is the way .   race has always been a hot button in this country &apos;s history and it needs to be pushed harder .   if we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony .  it &apos;s about promoting racial healing . 
that &apos;s a great handle . 
we gonna hit  &apos;em wid da bomb dickey on dis &apos; one .   what &apos;s the setting ? 
funnier to who and at who &apos;s expense ?  dunwitty ,  when negroes start to run amok ,  the boycotts ,  when the demostrations commence ,  i &apos;m giving them your home address .   let &apos;s see how you like it when they picket your lawn in greenwich ,  connecticut . 
i did .   i &apos;m not an alcoholic .   i just like to drink . 
the truth is never let them seeya sweat .   you do that ,  that &apos;s half the battle . 
how long has my father been like this ? 
how was it ? 
manray was under our nose the whole time . 
hello . 
why did you even come up with that shit if you didn &apos;t want it made ? 
same here . 
what is this ? 
how long have you and hambone been hangin &apos; out ? 
that crazy brother of yours doesn &apos;t think so . 
what are you ?   a man or a mouse ?  are you a punk ?   punking out on me ? 
you shouldn &apos;t even be mad at me over sloan . 
to answer your question ,  there are a lot of negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons ? 
peerless ,  your father called . 
yes he did . 
even more reason to see him .   he &apos;ll be overjoyed with your success . 
you know how your daddy is . 
this is a tv show ,  not a music video . 
good luck ,  jukka .   do a good show . 
i never had a really real pair before . 
to come back to our roots . 
y &apos;know my lady lucindy ? 
i fell out of my bed last night . 
i slept too near where i fell out . 
hold on ,  you allegorical hypothesis .  don &apos;t cross words with me . 
dat &apos;s yo uncle ben .   that reminds me ,  i &apos;ve seen a lot of troubles lately . 
sleep  &apos;n eat ,  i was my wife &apos;s husband and grandchild at one and the same time .   and lo &apos; and behold ,  as the husband of a person &apos;s grandmother is his grandfather ,  i mantan ,  became my own grandfather . 
how did you get this gig ? 
so you say .   sloan ,  you wuz gonna use me up just like you used dela ?  work it to the top .   i never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like  &quot; ihop .  &quot;   i &apos;m damn happy dela fired ya ass . 
is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel ? 
pooh !   pooh !   best ,  you are joking . 
ah !   you sly rogue ,  i see that will influence you . 
well ,  if it must be ,  it must .   for a young fellow ,  you are the most bloodthirsty i ever saw .   no officer ,  bearing his majesty &apos;s commission ,  can receive a glass of wine on his nose ,  without resenting it  -  -  fight you must ,  and best is a huge ,  strong fellow . 
that &apos;s a very handsome sword you have there . 
whom have i been harboring in my house ?   who are you ,  sirrah ? 
chevalier ,  though i cannot say how ,  i believe you have cheated me . 
i don &apos;t know . 
it is shameful  -  -  infamous !   i insist upon being put down at the austrian ambassador &apos;s house . 
all europe shall hear of this ! 
you come highly recommended by herr seebach . 
who else can give me information about you ? 
perfectly so; and what is more ,  i will tell you that i love her ,  and that i am not of a humor to put up with rivals . 
but if ,  when i love ,  i am unhappy ,  i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune . 
to make me wretched in two weeks . 
i know better than you do .   love wants a more substantial fare ,  and if it is stubbornly withheld ,  it withers away . 
lady cosgrove ,  you are an old fool . 
if ever i meet him again ,  you shall see which is the best man of the two .   i &apos;ll fight him with sword or with pistol ,  captain as he is . 
what ,  with me on the pillion ?   would you kill poor me ? 
was he cheated ? 
a meeting with the prince of turbingen is impossible . 
what has happened ,  madam ,  to annoy your ladyship ? 
that fool didn &apos;t know what was the meaning of a hundred - pound bill ,  which was in the pocket - book that the fellow took from me . 
mister bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life ,  and meditated a separation ,  in which case ,  she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance ,  and subject them ,  at any rate ,  to a doubtful and expensive litigation .  they were quite insistent on this point ,  and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship &apos;s perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital . 
good night ,  papa . 
yes ,  he &apos;s fine . 
yes .   he brought me in his carriage ,  and he will call for me at midnight . 
you framed - him .  .  . 
you killed him you fucking faggot  -  - 
shut the fuck up ,  you fucking faggot ,  you just shut the fuck up . 
there &apos;s no need .  .  . 
not true ,  cadet ,  i &apos;ve got a gun  -  - 
i guess nunez wasn &apos;t dead after all .  he came after us with a vengeance .   you know the rest . 
dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty -  four hours !  he is not to be given food ,  water ,  or clothes !  if he so much as moves ,  you are to blow his nigger brains out ,  is that clear ? 
shut up .   let me see your grenades . 
so you killed him ? 
you know it &apos;s not like that  -  - 
you hated west ,  mueller loved him  -  - 
my father is a powerful man .  over the years he &apos;s used that power to protect me ,  in one form or another ,  from certain .  .  .  unpleasantries .   i am a homosexual . 
okay .  i think that &apos;s it .  he rises and walks to the door . 
somebody emptied a full clip into him  -  - 
is it the truth ? 
why did you tell us he shot everybody ,  levi ?  you put him in for three murders ,  the man saved your life  -  - 
something funny ,  levi ? 
we &apos;ve already been over the terrain twice .  nothing . 
nevertheless  -  - 
tom ,  where are you going  -  - 
what i said before  -  - 
they &apos;re taking your command ,  aren &apos;t they ? 
you &apos;re a good soldier ,  bill . 
stay where you are . 
toxicology report came back .  kendall &apos;s attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine ,  maybe you &apos;ve heard of it .  it &apos;s for asthmatics .  if an epileptic takes enough ,  it kills them .  i checked with the nurses at the hospital  -  -  you &apos;re the only other person who visited kendall . 
no more witnesses .  west &apos;s a ghost .  but it doesn &apos;t matter because we have your signature ,  the hospital log ,  and kendall &apos;s toxicology report .  and that &apos;ll be enough . 
ah ,  christ
i didn &apos;t mean that as a compliment . 
gotta be honest ,  i love what you &apos;ve done with the place  -  - 
is dunbar cute ? 
thank you .  at some point in there i &apos;m gonna rub my nose .  when i do ,  go at him with everything you got . 
something wrong ? 
why the fuck wasn &apos;t he in restraints ? 
why do you care ? 
we can tie you to the chair if it &apos;ll work better for you  -  - 
no bodies ,  no west .  .  . 
your phone number ? 
they found him .  poor fucker was practically blown in half  -  - 
he said what ? 
dunbar says you were . 
dunbar &apos;s telling the truth . 
what happened with nunez ? 
thank god .  .  . 
goddammit ,  ray ,  we gotta get out of here  -  - 
so ? 
search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup .  if they &apos;re hurt and we can get to them in time .  .  . 
what happens to dunbar now ? 
hey kid !  your friend just made himself a star . 
jesus ,  kid .   let me guess .  real pretty ,  blonde hair ,  blue hat ? 
her name is sandra templeton .  she &apos;s going to auburn .  the semester &apos;s almost over ,  so you better hurry .

fine ,  you do it . 
you get the eye ? 
well ,  she .  .  .  uh .  .  . 
yeah . 
in so many words ,  yes . 
means when you dream about something that &apos;s going to happen .   like one night ,  i had a dream where this crow came and told me ,   &quot; your aunt is going to die .  &quot;  i was so scared i woke up my parents .  they told me it was just a dream ,  to go back to bed .  but the next morning ,  my aunt stacy was dead . 
will never told you that ?   probably just as well .  he would have told it all wrong anyway .  all the facts and none of the flavor . 
is it the medicine that &apos;s making you thirsty ?

you know where the chemicals are ? 
josephine actually went to the congo last year . 
son ? 
dad ! 
you tell lies ,  dad .  you tell amusing lies .  stories are what you tell a five - year old at bedtime .  they &apos;re not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty .  and the thing is ,  i believed you .  i believed your stories so much longer than i should have .  and then when i realized that everything you said was impossible  -  -  everything !   -  -  i felt like such a fool to have trusted you .  you were like santa claus and the easter bunny combined .  just as charming and just as fake . 
how did you get so many ?

i &apos;ve heard of sugai .   i &apos;ve also heard of the emperor .   they &apos;re both national treasures .   one &apos;s a hood . 
my japanese isn &apos;t that hot .  .  .  besides ,  you &apos;ll never get in . 
i still think you &apos;re a bastard . 
sugai won &apos;t give it to me ,  you know that . 
he &apos;s wanted in japan .   they want him first .   then we can have him . 
seven years work by the finest engraver .   mass produced ,  sequentially numbered .   the best there has ever been ,  mr .  conklin . 
i took kobo from the street .   i gave him a home ,  a future .  .  .  but my ways were too slow for him .  .  .  i served seven years in prison for my boss when i was a young man .   kobo wouldn &apos;t serve seven minutes for his oyabun .   he was supposed to take over this syndicate when i retired . 
why tell me this ? 
we &apos;re not used to the big city .  where we come from it &apos;s not so easy to get lost . 
he knows what he &apos;s doing . 
i &apos;m sure glad you found us ,  sebastian .   what do you think ,  mary ? 
let &apos;s go while there is still time . 
what &apos;s the point ? 
and what can he do for you ? 
would you like to be modified ? 
then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells . 
also you &apos;re too valuable to experiment with . 
i like a man who stays put .   an admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times .  you live here all by yourself ,  do you ? 
why are you staring at us ? 
what ,  sebastian ? 
we have a lot in common . 
what about your friend ,  the man who owns this building ? 
he could ? 
i &apos;d be happy to mention it to him . 
no . 
then we &apos;re stupid and we &apos;ll die . 
here &apos;s something you might find interesting .   they have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum .  however ,  after a period of time it is only logical that such a  &apos;mechanism &apos; would create its own emotional responses ,  hate ,  love ,  fear ,  anger ,  envy . 
not if it works . 
you like to kiss her goodbye . 
hey ,  it &apos;s okay .   i like to pee .  so how are you doing ? 
you &apos;re going to be over the limit . 
you see i lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little .  .  .  what am i supposed to be looking for ? 
what shows ? 
are you for real ? 
are you apprehensive ? 
there &apos;s two reasons a man rejects help .   either because he &apos;s so good at what he does he doesn &apos;t think he needs it ,  or he &apos;s so insecure he can &apos;t admit it . 
you ever take a bath with a man before ? 
did you cry when your father died ? 
when was the last time you cleaned this place ? 
but if i don &apos;t plug it in how can i .  .  . 
you know what i think ?

but in your profession that is a risk . 
how many questions does it usually take ,  mr .  deckard ?

hello !  it &apos;s anchorage !   gotcha ! 
it &apos;s so small . 
mt .  mckinley .   it &apos;s also the highest point in north america . 
that would knock my father out . 
 .  .  . i guess it &apos;s .  .  . just a matter of personal taste . 
you dial nine to get out . 
twenty - five ?  around there . 
whatcha looking at ? 
he seems to be doing all right now .   i don &apos;t know if he &apos;s had a heart attack or just .  .  .  a horrifying experience .  but we  need supplies and i &apos;ve got to stay with him . 
you know ,  i don &apos;t think so .  i &apos;m confused but you know ,  i don &apos;t think he &apos;d ever hurt me .  i don &apos;t think he &apos;d hurt anyone . 
according to caltech ,  this webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase . 
you got a light ,  honey ?

yes ,  you certainly will .  and you &apos;ll find a nice girl and rebuild america .  just the way it used to be . 
i &apos;m going to give it to you straight .  there &apos;s no point in beating around the bush .  there were survivors .  apparently ,  the fallout has created .  .  .  . a subspecies of mutants . 
they &apos;ve done a lot of re - building but society ,  at least as we knew it ,  has utterly collapsed .  people throw up in the streets .  others point guns .  there &apos;s something terribly wrong with the automobiles and .  .  . and i .  .  . i can &apos;t tell you the rest .   i just can &apos;t . 
we stay down here .

scarecrow ? 
what &apos;s wrong with applejack ?

you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re getting into here . 
sorry to wake you . 
moscow ?  what the hell &apos;s he going to moscow for ? 
sir .  .  . 
something &apos;s been going on here in europe .  and it &apos;s still going on .  post conklin .  who &apos;s been in berlin ? 
show me again .  .  . 
it &apos;s nice .   does this picture mean anything to you ?   hmm ? 
because you &apos;re afraid ! 
try again . 
you &apos;re lying .  if it &apos;s over ,  why are they after me ? 
you are better .  and i think it &apos;s not memories at all .  it &apos;s just a dream you keep having over and over . 
no .  .  .  how ? 
you drive . 
switch !  you drive ! 
jesus !   -  -    -  -  is he back there ?   -  - 
i wanted to kill him . 
see that tram coming around the corner ? 
that &apos;s a lie ! 
okay ,  how do you want to do it ? 
who ? 
where am i ? 
alright .  .  .  take it down . 
we &apos;ll know for sure when we get the security tapes . 
okay ,  cut to the chase ,  pam .  what are you selling ? 
did you ? 
some women like dobermans  -  - 
i don &apos;t think we need to keep looking for him anyway . 
here &apos;s what i &apos;ve got .   remember vladimir neski ?  russian politician ?  seven years ago ,  he was due to speak to a group of european oil ministers here at the hotel .  he never did .  he was murdered . 
peace ?  ! 
a wise plan .  and how is your father ?  we have missed him at the council . 
if i pay homage to another &apos;s throne ,  then how am i a king ? 
what news of the north ? 
the weapon has been outlawed by the pope himself ! 
no ,  m &apos;lord . 
i have come to beg for the life of william wallace . 
the bruce is not coming ,  william . 
stephen ready ? 
wanna stay with me tonight ? 
where is my son ? 
i do not confess . 
your father doesn &apos;t like me ,  does he ? 
i want .  .  .  to marry you ! 
but i won &apos;t give you up to any nobleman . 
then when ? 
i am the princess of wales . 
why did you ? 
you understand .  consider ,  before you laugh and say no .  you will never own a throne ,  though you deserve one .  but just as the sun will rise tomorrow ,  some man will rule england .  and what if his veins ran not with the blood of longshanks ,  but with that of a true king ? 
wait !   .  .  . i respect what you said .  but remember ,  these men have lands ,  castles .  much to risk . 
we can &apos;t stop ! 
what &apos;s the crazy man saying ,  lord ? 
i thought i was dead when ya pulled that dagger ! 
we &apos;ve been over this a hundred times .  it &apos;s too dangerous for him . 
all the dads are gonna be there . 
that &apos;s why i wanted you to come here ,  evan .  dr .  redfield already has a background in memory loss . 
why do you ask ? 
i couldn &apos;t tell if they were real memories or just phantoms .  you know ,  he might only have thought he actually remembered them .  .  . 
there must be a way to fix this . 
just tell me if anything weird happens . 
okay .  then go a little forward in time .  what do you see now ? 
hey ,  evan .  what &apos;s the big rush ?  we don &apos;t meet for another hour . 
just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure ,  it gets all of the worm &apos;s memories . 
you really think he wanted to kill you ? 
we should go soon .  if dad catches us smoking down here ,  we &apos;re dead . 
no ,  evan .  i don &apos;t know .  it &apos;s been a long time .  fill me in . 
no .  i emancipated myself when i was fifteen . 
not if you remember my dad . 
where .  .  .  where are my clothes ? 
please ,  evan .  don &apos;t even joke .  he wouldn &apos;t hurt you .  he &apos;s just trying to scare you away from me . 
are you okay ? 
i want you to take this ,  lenny .  today &apos;s your day of atonement .  i know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby  -  - 
oh ,  i thought you were my eight o &apos;clock .  make it fast ,  i &apos;m expecting someone . 
evan ,  you &apos;re hysterical .  you study for this ? 
thanks .  wow .  hey ,  i want to do something really special for kayleigh tomorrow .  if i said i needed some help from you and the brothers .  .  . 
so what &apos;s the point ? 
can .  .  .  can .  .  .  can i have this ? 
destroy it ? 
look what you made me do ! 
lung cancer ? 
mom .  don &apos;t cry .  i can change this . 
just get out ,  didja ? 
wipe that sad - assed look off your face before you get us all busted .  you see the way evan &apos;s mom was looking at you ? 
monsieur rick ? 
i should have known . 
how long have you been married ? 
nobody ever loved me that much . 
well ,  you are in pretty good shape ,  herr rick . 
yes ,  i come . 
here you are . 
fine ,  but i would like to buy your cafe . 
i see the bus is in .  i &apos;ll take my shipment with me . 
we &apos;ve decided ,  signor ferrari .  for the present we &apos;ll go on looking for two exit visas .  thank you very much . 
rick ? 
it is possible the french authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here . 
 -  -  it was  &quot; la belle aurore .  &quot; 
say goodnight to sam for me . 
yes ? 
was that cannon fire ,  or is it my heart pounding ? 
yes ,  of course ,  we  -  - 
oh .  i saved my first drink to have with you .  here . 
please don &apos;t .  don &apos;t ,  rick .  i can understand how you feel . 
it &apos;s about a girl who had just come to paris from her home in oslo .  at the house of some friends she met a man about whom she &apos;d heard her whole life ,  a very great and courageous man .  he opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals .  everything she knew or ever became was because of him .  and she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love . 
i told you this morning you &apos;d come around ,  but this is a little ahead of schedule .  well ,  won &apos;t you sit down ? 
you use  &quot; richard &quot;  again ?  we &apos;re back in paris . 
but why my name ,  richard ? 
no ,  richard ,  no .  what has happened to you ?  last night we said  -  - 
yes . 
some of the old songs ,  sam . 
play it once ,  sam ,  for old time &apos;s sake . 
play it ,  sam .  play  &quot; as time goes by .  &quot; 
goodnight . 
we are only interested in two visas ,  signor . 
yes ,  i see .  when i had trouble getting out of lille ,  why didn &apos;t you leave me there ?  and when i was sick in marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time ,  why didn &apos;t you leave me then ? 
our faithful friend is still there . 
did he give any reason ? 
yes ,  yes i know .  victor ,  whatever i do ,  will you believe that i ,  that  -  - 
be careful . 
yes . 
well then ,  perhaps you also  -  -  - 
and i congratulate you . 
good morning . 
isn &apos;t it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog ? 
you know how you sound ,  monsieur blaine ?  like a man who &apos;s trying to convince himself of something he doesn &apos;t believe in his heart .  each of us has a destiny ,  for good or for evil . 
monsieur laszlo ,  is it not ? 
i am captain renault ,  prefect of police . 
let us say that it is my request .  that is a much more pleasant word . 
ricky ,  you &apos;re becoming quite human .  i suppose we have to thank you for that ,  mademoiselle . 
i am delighted to see you both .  did you have a good night &apos;s rest ? 
i believe you have a message for him ? 
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll excuse me if i am not gracious ,  but you see ,  major strasser ,  i &apos;m a czechoslovakian . 
you may find the climate of casablanca a trifle warm ,  major . 
mademoiselle . 
why do you stand here ?  why don &apos;t you stop him ? 
i see .  and what &apos;s strasser doing here ?  he certainly didn &apos;t come all the way to casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency . 
how observant you are .  as a matter of fact ,  i wanted to give you a word of advice . 
it is my duty to see that he doesn &apos;t impress the other half .  rick ,  laszlo must never reach america .  he stays in casablanca . 
manages what ? 
i have my orders . 
well ,  ricky .  i &apos;m very pleased with you .  now you &apos;re beginning to live like a frenchman . 
well ,  i told strasser he wouldn &apos;t find the letters here .  but i told my men to be especially destructive .  you know how that impresses germans ?   rick ,  have you got these letters of transit ? 
but you haven &apos;t any actual proof ,  and you know it .  this isn &apos;t germany or occupied france .  all you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days .  you might as well let him go now . 
i thought i asked you to tie up your watchdogs . 
call off your watch - dogs you said . 
well i was right .  you are a sentimentalist . 
i suppose you know this isn &apos;t going to be pleasant for either of us ,  especially for you .  i &apos;ll have to arrest you of course . 
it might be a good idea for you to disappear from casablanca for a while .  there &apos;s a free french garrison over at brazzaville .  i could be induced to arrange a passage . 
and that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses . 
make it official ,  if you like . 
i understand you came here from paris at the time of the occupation . 
well ,  there are certain sections of new york ,  major ,  that i wouldn &apos;t advise you to try to invade . 
but why ?  oh ,  you object to the kind of business i do ,  huh ?  but think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if i didn &apos;t help them .  that &apos;s not so bad .  through ways of my own i provide them with exit visas . 
perhaps an hour ,  perhaps a little longer . 
boss ,  ain &apos;t you going to bed ? 
what &apos;s that you &apos;re playing ? 
it took this test package thirty - two hours to get from seattle to st .  petersburg ,  a distance of nine thousand miles .   and then it took forty - one hours to get from our warehouse in st .  petersburg to here ,  a distance of ,  what  -  - 
can &apos;t .   need water . 
no more water ,  you said . 
if they can &apos;t see you ,  what &apos;s the point ? 
polaris ,  where are you ?   maybe i &apos;m too far south . 
you &apos;re beautiful .   marry me . 
what are you smiling about ?   they &apos;ll be back . 
yeah .   a long time ago . 
no .   that was the last one . 
keep painting .   promise me . 
ah ,  the staff meeting could have gone better . 
hey ,  look at you . 
 &quot; we &apos;re &quot;  not over - reacting . 
why didn &apos;t you come over ,  get mad at me ,  tell me what a stupid bitch i was . 
what ,  you were going to come over the next day all calm and say ,  kelly that really made me mad ?   don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re mad .   be mad .   be who you are right now . 
i would never  -  - 
come on .   try . 
so simple to say ,  so hard to do . 
i need the latest pdrs on st .  petersburg . 
need some help ? 
you &apos;re chuck noland . 
thought you were going to bring her . 
really ? 
it seemed like she had such a good time last time . 
i &apos;ve got all this back pay coming .   why don &apos;t you let me get you a place in town ? 
jesus .   i got it working .  .  .  you have no idea how hard it was .  .  .  they &apos;re finally a team .  .  . 
i didn &apos;t know we had sailboats . 
you &apos;re fucking dead ! 
hello . 
cool ropes . 
permission to come aboard ,  sir . 
they want to replace me !  the board of trustees wants to *replace* me ! 
he *smells* like he could put you to sleep ! 
*you &apos;re* a doctor ,  homer -  - you don &apos;t smell like ether . 
yeah .  but sometimes i wish i could meet mine ,  anyway . 
i think mary agnes could kill someone . 
what are you going to tell the little ones ? 
i better go . 
and what did she die of ,  exactly ? 
just tell me .  i &apos;ll do whatever you want to do . 
isn &apos;t that like waiting and seeing ? 
if you &apos;re trying to be funny ,  homer .  .  . 
 &quot;  .  .  . did .  &quot;  well ,  okay . 
and now that wally &apos;s coming back ,  and because he &apos;ll certainly *need* you .  .  . 
i &apos;m okay -  - i can walk . 
that &apos;s a heavy sedation . 
*liver* killed him ? 
but did you know him ? 
what &apos;s an immigrant ? 
i &apos;m sorry .  they &apos;re not used to seeing a car like this . 
has anyone offered you anything to eat ? 
 &quot; burma run &quot;  because you fly over burma .  .  . 
it &apos;s big enough to keep you out of the war ,  i suppose .  ain &apos;t that right ? 
i think you been stayin &apos; up too late at night ,  homer . 
ain &apos;t nobody havin &apos; *sex* with my little girl ,  homer -  - that &apos;s somethin &apos; a father knows . 
you know *how* to help these women -  -  how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can &apos;t get help anywhere else ? 
okay ,  he &apos;s just a wilbur then . 
it &apos;s just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people . 
you okay ,  rose ? 
shit .  we don &apos;t know what he is . 
i fail to see how a little christianity could *hurt* anyone here ! 
they told me i was too old to serve . 
don &apos;t this place look like home ? 
they &apos;re *outrageous* ,  them rules ! 
it &apos;s that vernon -  - he keeps askin &apos; where you and homer and rose rose is at . 
i told him that you all is sick . 
that sounds like you is in trouble already ,  homer . 
we should drown that damn jack in the vat ! 
rose rose has runned away ! 
silicon valley ? 
oh .  well ,  thanks for the drink . 
that &apos;s right .  and tech firms .  .  .  they  &apos;tend to scare people off . 
let &apos;s just slow down for a second .  .  . 
same thing with playing a con .  you have to be able to see that deep . 
hey ,  jake .  .  .  when am i gonna get to play the inside ? 
yeah ,  but come on .  .  .  all i get to do is cry and get insulted . 
and i think it &apos;s because of this redhead .  .  . 
things are probably going to end badly for you ,  jake . 
like what ? 
the red hair .  .  .  it &apos;s bad luck . 
poor bastard never knew what hit him .  jesus ,  i almost felt sorry for the guy . 
we only owe the king a hundred and fifty . 
she up for this ? 
calls ? 
here and there ,  scooter ?  here and there like boston ,  chicago ,  houston ?  the bay area ?  some action in london ,   &apos;til it turned nickel and dime .  or how about that little stint down in miami ?  heard you actually got into some trouble with the feds down there .  you guy &apos;s pretty good ? 
let me repeat  -  -  why not ? 
fucking grifters !  i love it !  you got balls ,  i &apos;ll give you that much . 
how much ? 
don &apos;t get me wrong ,  jake .  i like you boys .  you guys are the steadiest business in town .  but what can i say ?  twenty percent &apos;s still better than what we give to any of the other criminals . 
that tip not work - out for you fellas ? 
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re into with the king pin ,  but whatever it is we get a piece ,  understand ?  we get a big piece .  if we find out you &apos;re keeping us out ,  i may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to moonan myself .  say something stupid if we got a deal ,  jake . 
i lost my head .  i &apos;m .  .  .  sorry .  i don &apos;t know what happened . 
we have work .  it pays a lot .  unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up . 
we had to see what your deal was .  i &apos;m just a little superstitious . 
what about customs ? 
mr .  king ,  i think  -  - 
we &apos;re going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy ,  if not be classy .  you gotta do this thing and i don &apos;t even know if you can . 
i don &apos;t trust anyone . 
you just put a mother of a jinx on us . 
why ?  your mother not breast feed you or something ? 
no .  you trusted him .  .  .  you were just getting square . 
you are such a raving pussy sometimes . 
tick - tock .  .  . 
it &apos;s bad luck . 
him . 
i &apos;m sorry .  nothing under pearson . 
what i &apos;m saying is ,  is that the king ain &apos;t gonna care .  see he had a real thing with getting this gillette guy ,  if you ask me i think he &apos;s jealous . 
exactly .   &apos;cept this gillette guy .  he gets to walk around in three piece suits ,  hob knob with the mayor ,  own a bank ,  that kinda shit .  meanwhile ,  the king sits holed up in the steam ,  afraid to even take a leak without me or harlin watching the door . 
egg foo young .   stand up . 
and like in a game of chess ,  you &apos;ve played every possible move in your head .  .  . 
what ? 
coupla things .  they got this fed looking around and the girl just split . 
did he buy it ? 
it &apos;s just insurance . 
i &apos;m bella . 
hi ,  jack .   welcome to the cesspit . 
not like matt ,  you mean . 
what are you laughing at ?  who was that on the phone ? 
how about fifteen hundred ? 
jack ,  look ,  next weekend i &apos;m having a house party .  here .  .  .   it &apos;s near oxford .  why don &apos;t you come ?  it &apos;ll just be social .  no business .   bring a friend .  i &apos;ve plenty of room . 
i found her in bed with someone . 
take it back .  till you sell your book . 
i had training .  in the republic . 
are you drunk ? 
what are you doing here ?   you know the rules . 
i don &apos;t like it at all .  you had a wonderful character before ,  the gambler .  he was so romantic . 
don &apos;t be stubborn .  the pay won &apos;t be grand ,  but it &apos;s regular .  that &apos;s what you need ,  isn &apos;t it ?  i know you don &apos;t like taking my advice .  .  . 
yes ,  i know that . 
i &apos;ve lived there . 
i &apos;m not much of a gambler really .  i just like this bar . 
i was at a loose end .  a friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership . 
no ,  no .  i come every couple of years .  i always think i &apos;m going to stay .  i &apos;m from cape town originally
now there &apos;s a coincidence .  my father used to gamble there . 
i &apos;m in trouble . 
but if it does . 
it &apos;s all relative .   i need the money too . 
yes . 
detective inspector ross . 
what are you ,  a cop ? 
so it &apos;s mr clean .  wise up ,  jack ,  this whole business is bent .  the casino is nothing but legal theft .  and that &apos;s ok .  it &apos;s the system .  half the punters who come in are using stolen money ,  drug money ,  they haven &apos;t earned it .  we earn our money .   i &apos;m on your side ,  jack .  i don &apos;t need an enemy . 
and the girls ? 
david reynolds ,  i &apos;m the manager here .  sit down ,  john . 
you &apos;ve been recommended by the management here .  they know your father .  he has a bit of a reputation ,  hasn &apos;t he ? 
where did you go to school ? 
why four ?  and not three or five ? 
you use two alternating ,  don &apos;t you ? 
i make it six . 
you want me to check ? 
let me just run through a few things .  as a dealer you never gamble ,  not anywhere .  we &apos;ll need your picture . 
you can start monday week . 
i have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand . 
the one on unit .  .  .  oh ,  i think it &apos;s gmr twelve zero zero . 
yeah . 
i can tell ,  the damn thing just doesn &apos;t understand . 
it didn &apos;t go off . 
well .  .  .  now what ?  what do ,  you have for us now .  boiler ? 
swell .  let &apos;s synchronize detonation time .  do you know when you &apos;re supposed to go off ? 
one hundred twenty seconds to drop ,  bomb ,  have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding ? 
do you remember the detonation time ? 
hello ,  bomb ,  are you with me ? 
well of course i exist . 
 .  .  . you may be doing so on the basis of false data . 
i need a ghf reading on the gravity correction . 
what are you gonna name it ? 
talby ! 
you know ,  talby ,  you really ought to eat with the rest of us .  you spend too much time up here . 
lieutenant doolittle ,  this is talby .  lieutenant ?

i &apos;m going into them ,  i &apos;m going to hit them .  doolittle .  .  . 
commander powell ,  this is doolittle .  ah ,  there &apos;s something serious come up ,  sir ,  and i have to ask you something . 
what &apos;s that ,  sir ? 
you don &apos;t understand ,  sir ,  we can &apos;t get the bomb to drop . 
negative effect . 
sorry ,  sir ,  you faded out there for a minute . 
commander ?  are you still there ? 
we &apos;re running out of time ,  sir . 
sir ? 
no wire . 
fine .   so call her .   get her over here . 
ass like your ,  i can see why he &apos;s worried you &apos;ll punk . 
i was crazy about you .  .  . am crazy about you .   but you keep everyone at arm &apos;s length like there &apos;s some great big dark something going on that -  -  i don &apos;t know .  .  .  it &apos;s just that the more i tried to get close to you ,  the more you pulled away . 
out there . 
where &apos;d you clip this ? 
must think you &apos;re pretty special laying this on you . 
same old story .   not interested . 
what &apos;re you looking for ? 
which means i gotta fence it for two .  who &apos;s got that kinda scrilla lying around ,  these being the worst of the times . 
i made you coffee .   that oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little . 
what &apos;s with you ?   every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he &apos;s family . 
no .  .  . 
thank god . 
i was expecting someone else . 
you have good taste .   french ,  1920 &apos;s ,  attributed to chitarus . 
lemme get my coat . 
so now you tracked me down .   what d &apos;ya think ? 
you miss the good ol &apos; days .   even though there were still poor people who died from diseases when they didn &apos;t have to .  and rich people spent obscene amounts of money redecorating their houses to match the cat .   those good ol &apos; days ? 
whoa there ,  tex !   we &apos;ve been through all this . 
gold leaf ,  art nouveau ,  french ,  early nineteen hundreds .  .  .  i could probably fence this for three or four grand . 
yeah .  .  . a made - up creature .   like in mythology .  .  . with the head of a lion ,  the body of a goat and the tail of .  .  . 
they &apos;ve lost track of me and i plan to keep it that way . 
forty - seven people drowned last night off the coast of vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into canada so they could get work in order to eat .   only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead . 
these girls ,  kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder .   the oldest is twelve .   the youngest about the same age you were when you escaped . 
know where i can find her ? 
what do you want ? 
who are you ? 
how do i know you &apos;re telling the truth ? 
i think you should go now . 
say the words ,   &quot; i understand .  &quot; 
who &apos;s this guy ?   this isn &apos;t who we &apos;re looking for .  .  . her name was hannah . 
thank you . 
what about the other kids ?   you get anything on them ? 
as long as you &apos;re okay . 
whoever tossed this place wants you .   and i &apos;m looking to stay outta the line of fire . 
i need a favor .  .  .  i need you to trace a number for me . 
morning ,  sunshine .  .  . 
at least he didn &apos;t swing with your ride . 
no . 
because you &apos;re probably my closest friend in the whole world . 
a fog bank . 
unlikely . 
only one i can think of . 
right after you change your wardrobe ,  your personality and drop about thirty pounds . 
make the call . 
can you put that in a bag or something ? 
you left out condescending . 
and why should she ? 
this is a hot run .   beat it .   you &apos;re late . 
no ,  i mean .  .  .  you love your son ? 
you &apos;re a little scrawny ,  but thanks to the concert we &apos;re low on amateurs .  name ? 
whoa .  .  .  she is a killer . 
oh ,  dicky ,  i c - c - can &apos;t .  .  . 
your man is the drummer ,  peter criss ,  right ?

wonder if you could smoke shit out of this ? 
you call that john travolta / denny terio shit dancing ?  i wouldn &apos;t dance like that in private if you paid me . 
will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead . 
we are not stealing my mom &apos;s car . 
sunday ,  but .  .  . 
very funny ,  hawk .  okay ,  i &apos;m in on this hare - brained scheme ,  but if anything happens to my mom &apos;s car ,  i &apos;m blaming you .  i &apos;ll say you drugged me or something . 
now ,  how are we gonna do this ? 
cool ,  bro ,  now listen up .  .  . 
i think we should try sneaking in . 
well ,  let &apos;s recap ,  shall we ?  you slapped all of us ,  yelled at me ,  used my head for a rag ,  threw me on the ground and tossed our love gun 8 -  track under the wheels of a passing semi .   so ,  if the lesson was that you &apos;re a dick with ears and a really bad haircut ,  then ,  yes .  .  .  i &apos;d say we learned it . 
where the hell am i gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour ? 
dude ,  if it were dancing the way fred astaire did it ,  i &apos;d give it my best shot .  i &apos;d learn the steps and practice in my spare time .  but this .  .  .  tribal ,  ritualistic bullshit ,  it &apos;s way - too - spontaneous for me . 
they &apos;re still at my house in trip &apos;s jacket . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  guys .  i thought it was a nice thing to do . 
wait !  i know how we can get in ! 
but .  .  .  my plan involves all four of us acting together . 
ahh ,  sunshine . 
jeremiah .  .  .  what &apos;s gotten into you ? 
no . 
trip ,  a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make .  and even if it did ,  at least my mom didn &apos;t give birth to me while she was on lsd . 
the chinese have a proverb :   &quot; that which appears too good to be true ,  usually is .  &quot;  there &apos;s gotta be a catch . 
twenty - five more &apos;n i got . 
please ,  sir ,  don &apos;t kick my ass !  i &apos;ll do anything to get out of a beating ! 
oh ,  yeah !  you and what army ? 
what happened ? 
so .  .  .  according to hawking .  .  .  wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space - time . 
beg pardon ? 
how can you do that ? 
how old is grandma death ? 
so .  .  .  you just moved here ? 
wow .  did he go to jail ? 
don &apos;t knock soap .  without it ,  disease would spread rapidly .  if we ran out .  .  .  you and i would never live to see the year 2000 . 
so when you sleepwalk ,  can you remember afterward ?  like ,  do you dream ? 
what happened to your neck ? 
babies cry because they &apos;re afraid of the dark .  and because they have no memories .  .  .  for all they know .  .  .  every night could be the last forever .  like ,  perpetual darkness . 
we &apos;re moving through time . 
i &apos;ve been seeing stuff .  .  .  a lot of really messed - up stuff .   do you know who grandma death is ? 
what ? 
well ,  life isn &apos;t that simple .  so what if ling ling kept the cash and returned the wallet ?  that has nothing to do with either fear or love . 
if i &apos;m lucky .   so .  .  .  i won &apos;t be back until the first .  your dad will be back on sunday ,  so i &apos;ve put elizabeth in charge until then .  she has the car .  .  .  so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow . 
and when i clap my hands twice ,  you will wake up .  do you understand ? 
what is her name ? 
do you think a lot about girls ? 
how are things going at school ? 
who is the boss ? 
can anyone else see him ? 
who is they ?  is frank part of some larger group ? 
nothing . 
i have to obey him .  .  .  because he saved my life .  he controls me and i have to obey him or i &apos;ll be left all alone .  .  .  and i &apos;ll never figure out what all of this means .  .  . 
because i &apos;m so horny . 
it &apos;s not that .  i mean mouthing off to your teachers .  i &apos;ll admit .  .  .  when dad told me what you said to ms .  farmer ,  i laughed my ass off . 
did you just call me a fuck - ass ? 
kitty .  .  . 
what is this shit ? 
wicked . 
smurfette doesn &apos;t fuck . 
is mom okay ? 
you &apos;re what ?  ! 
hell - no ,  she ain &apos;t quittin &apos; . 
it &apos;s all the stuff i get to do .  oh my god ,  oh my god .  .  .  okay ,  okay .  .  .  we get a  &quot; personal consultation &quot;  with a make - up artist  -  -  eeeh !  okay ,  um ,  there &apos;ll be a choreographer to the stars and ,  oh no  -  -  no way .  oh .  .  .  my .  .  .  god ! 
shut up ,  yous guys .  look ,  amber ,  i &apos;m not gonna win .  and let &apos;s be honest ,  a family only needs one  &quot; liza &quot;  and you know peter &apos;s got much better legs than me . 
i  -  -  i &apos;m wearin &apos; this costume .  i &apos;m ,  uh ,  i &apos;m gonna do my talent tonight . 
relax ,  that &apos;s my ma &apos;s code for ,   &quot; bring home milk and a carton - a luckys .  &quot; 
god i hope that &apos;s you and not your concussion talkin &apos; . 
okay ,  okay !   listen - up .  coupla notes from last night &apos;s dress rehearsal .   number one ,  gladys says a coupla yous are gettin &apos; sexy with your hips durin &apos; the  &quot; physical fitness &quot;  routine .  .  . 
uh ,  amber ?  we &apos;re not puttin &apos; on our talent costumes .  you need to put on your  &quot; physical fitness &quot;  outfit .  and let &apos;s shake a leg ,  ladies . 
but ,  doesn &apos;t someone taking your costume so you can &apos;t compete ,  overrule that rule ? 
what ? 
i know it doesn &apos;t matter ,  but on my inner thighs .

y &apos;know ,  if you have ,  you got all the pictures of the winner you need .

the bitch . 
lester ? 
iris ,  stop !   it &apos;s not his fault .  the communal wine just proves too temptin &apos; for some of them . 
you know that sometimes it &apos;s hard to understand god &apos;s great plan . 
okay ,  i designed the float ,  you know .  and ,  what &apos;s gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan . 
let &apos;s get this straight right now .  we wouldn &apos;t have been late at all if it wasn &apos;t for you . 
king solomon was game he gave each girl his name to number them would make a list that long i &apos;ll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong . 
here i am ,  father . 
that &apos;s not right yet .  .  .  put back  &quot; president &quot;  and take out  &quot; dear &quot;  .  .  .  how does it read now ? 
now we &apos;re on the right track .  .  .  put back  &quot; dear &quot;  .  .  .  how does it read ? 
go out and chase that peanut vendor away from the building  -  -  get rid of him if you have to use violence  -  if necessary call out the militia and if he isn &apos;t looking get me a bag of peanuts . 
eureka ammunition company  -  -  gentlemen  -  -  your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight  -  -   gloria ,  i could go for you in a big way  -  -   however ,  the rifles you sent were a little rusty  -  -    -  -  and i don &apos;t say that to everybody  -  -   have not received last month &apos;s drawing account .   how come ?   your neck is like a swan .  .  .   yours very truly .   now read it back .  
you haven &apos;t been still a moment since you &apos;ve been here .   you act as if you had neurosis  -  - 
have you got a license ? 
what do you whistle ? 
well ,  if you don &apos;t want your dog why don &apos;t you put him in a pound ? 
 &apos;at &apos;s - a no good .   i went to niagara falls once . 
no ,  but i shot some ducks . 
what other job you got ? 
that &apos;s no good .   i like to work on the outside .   i must have something easy . 
i don &apos;t wanna stick out my tongue . 
wait a minute .   what kind of an army do you think we oughtta have ? 
you no gotta no gun . 
well ,  we &apos;ll let that one go .   now  -  -  how many battalions you got ? 
if we should choose to chew ,  we &apos;ll be pursued  - 
i am willing to apologize .  .  .   i &apos;m willing to do anything to prevent this war . 
what &apos;ll i do with this card ? 
the future of freedonia rests upon you .   promise me you will follow in my husband &apos;s footsteps . 
so  -  -  you &apos;ve come to ask for clemency !  i &apos;ll give the enemy no quarter  -  -  not a dime .  .  . 
guard them with your life .  .  .  don &apos;t leave them out of your sight .  .  .   if the enemy gets those papers  we &apos;re lost .   if they don &apos;t get them ,  we &apos;re lost .   can &apos;t you see what i &apos;m trying to tell you ?   i love you .  .  .    mrs .  teasdale ,  you &apos;re the salt of the earth .   they don &apos;t come any better than you .  .  . 
i hope i &apos;m not interrupting . 
but  - 
one or two ? 
don &apos;t ! 
he &apos;s a clumsy git .  never watches where he is going . 
i like doing business with you .  you and i understand each other ,  completely .  i know i can trust you .  can &apos;t i ? 
don &apos;t be frightened .  he won &apos;t hurt you . 
two o &apos;clock then .  .  .  you know treves .  .  .  it seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance . 
you are quite right ,  treves ,  this is an exceptional case .  and i quite agree that the committee should see mr .  merrick . 
mr .  treves says that you are in the theatre .  do you live there ? 
john ,  i &apos;d like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the british stage ,  mrs .  kendal .  mrs .  kendal ,  john merrick . 
the hallway ?  oh ,  the wastecan ! 
i love the way you &apos;ve arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece .  is that the way it &apos;s done in most houses ? 
good morning ,  john . 
when will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye ?  when will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky ?  when will the clouds be aweary of fleeting ?  when will the heart be aweary of beating ,  and nature die ? 
my home . 
mr .  treves !  treves . 
goodnight john .  sleep well . 
good .  excellent .  now then ,  mrs .  mothershead ,  i want you to come into this room with me .  inside there is a man with a rather .  .  .  unfortunate appearance . 
he &apos;s had his share of  &quot; smacks &quot;  ,  mothershead .  i expect that &apos;s what drives him under the bed .  we must use patience and understanding with this man . 
watery headed bunch . 
incredible ,  isn &apos;t it ?  well ,  i think john has had enough visitors for one day ,  mothershead .  i &apos;ve got a lecture at the college ,  i &apos;ll be back this evening . 
yes sir .   what &apos;s that ? 
so you see ,  john ,  there &apos;s no need for a lighthouse .  all your friends are here . 
don &apos;t lie to me .  i know all about it .  you were seen .  where did you take him ? 
you bastard !  you tortured him .  you tortured him ,  you bastard .  where is he ? 
i &apos;d pay handsomely for a private showing .  are you the proprietor ? 
pardon me ? 
right !  where is he ? 
ah !  so you admit there is someone ! 
welcome ? 
but you loved her all the same .  .  . 
that &apos;s just what i was trying to tell you .  you are .  .  . 
just give me a hand . 
do you believe i love you ? 
erik !  you &apos;ve done what you came to do ! 
how do we know this is the way ? 
well ,  obviously there &apos;s no killing . 
er .  .  .  well .  .  .  we .  .  .  we .  .  .  would be terribly grateful if you .  .  .  all .  .  .  would sing for us . 
really . 
careful !   they &apos;re not supposed to hurt you . 
he &apos;s trying to stop us waking the gods . 
well ,  it &apos;s not called the horn resounding for nothing .   you do know how to play the horn ,  don &apos;t you ? 
of course i like women .  .  .  i love  &apos;em . 
no .  it isn &apos;t rape then ,  is it ? 
oh !  stop talking as if we were married ! 
find the rainbow bridge ? 
what are you talking about ? 
it &apos;s halfdan the black ! 
it &apos;s not magic !  it &apos;s just a trick ! 
what ? 
you talking piffle ,  son ? 
what did he say ? 
erik the viking !  the things you seek are not in our power .  we don &apos;t make men love each other or hate each other . 
a magic dishcloth . 
there is another way . 
what &apos;s the matter with them ? 
row ! 
i came to find my grandfather . 
i know .  i know . 
let me go ,  sven . 
what ? 
ooh ,  that &apos;s a good one !  you could charge halfdan fifteen for that one . 
help ! 
shut up ! 
you &apos;ve lost your mind . 
i was a berserk for king harald fairhair .  .  . 
you must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle . 
well ,  of course he is ! 
i don &apos;t know ,  honey .  it &apos;s horrible . 
thanks ,  guys . 
i remember . 
yeah ,  you told me that later . 
well ,  i &apos;ve been having a bad time of it with um ,  my boyfriend ,  i guess . 
maybe gay isn &apos;t the right word .  but ,  anyway ,  it &apos;s been rough with him .  .  .  whatever the fuck he is .  heheh .  my significant other .  .  .  heh heh .  and i guess on a certain level ,  i want to break it off ,  but i feel .  .  .  y &apos;know .  .  .  it &apos;s like this constant questioning and re questioning .  do i end it ?  should i give it more time ?  i &apos;m not happy ,  but what do i expect ?  relationships require work .  you know the drill .  the thing that i keep coming back to is ,  i &apos;m not getting any younger ,  i want to have a baby .  .  .  at some point .  .  .  maybe .  .  .  right ?  so then i think i should settle  -  -  which is not necessarily the best word  -  -  i mean ,  he &apos;s a good guy .  it &apos;s not really settling .  then i think maybe i &apos;m just a victim of movies ,  y &apos;know ?  that i have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be .  but then i think ,  no ,  this is what i really want ,  so i should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it .  you know ?  agreed ?  but then i think he is a good guy and .  .  .  it &apos;s complicated .  y &apos;know ? 
why what ? 
really ? 
i noticed your hair .  i guess it made an impression on me ,  that &apos;s why i was pretty sure i recognized you . 
i can &apos;t remember . 
i &apos;m sure you would . 
no jokes about my name ?  oh ,  you wouldn &apos;t do that; you &apos;re trying to be nice . 
i &apos;m sorry i .  .  .  yelled at you .  was it yelling ?  i can &apos;t really tell .  whatever ,  i &apos;m a little out of sorts today . 
hi .  i could give you a ride if you need . 
look ,  i &apos;m very sorry i came off sort of nutso .  i &apos;m not really . 
me too .  it is rain dogs ,  by the way . 
i don &apos;t know . 
god ,  that feels so fucking good .  take yours off . 
no .  i  -  - 
thanks . 
exactly .  exactly !  that &apos;s exactly my feeling about it .  it &apos;s hard to know .  like ,  okay ,  but how many times do i think something and it doesn &apos;t happen ?  that &apos;s what you &apos;re saying ,  right ?  you forget about those times .  right ? 
but i think i am .  i like to think i am . 
sorry .  my life isn &apos;t that interesting .  i go to work .  i go home .  i don &apos;t know what to say . 
what &apos;s the goal ,  joel ?   my goal ,  joel ,  is to just let it flow through me ?  do you know what i mean ?  it &apos;s like ,  there &apos;s all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and i think we &apos;re all taught we should be consistent .  y &apos;know ?  you love someone  -  -  that &apos;s it .  forever .  you choose to do something with your life  -  -  that &apos;s it ,  that &apos;s what you do .  it &apos;s a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through .  and my feeling is that &apos;s how you die ,  because you stop listening to what is true ,  and what is true is constantly changing .  you know ? 
like i wanted to talk to you .  i didn &apos;t need any more reason to do it .  who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist ? 
you &apos;re very nice .  god ,  i have to stop saying that .  you &apos;re nervous around me ,  huh ? 
well ,  for the last week ,  anyway !  he &apos;s kind of a kid .  kind of a goofball ,  but he &apos;s really stuck on me ,  which is flattering .  who wouldn &apos;t like that ?  and he &apos;s ,  like ,  a dope ,  but he says these smart and moving things sometimes ,  out of nowhere ,  that just break my heart .  he &apos;s the one who gave me that crow photograph . 
that made me cry .  but ,  anyway ,  we went up to boston ,  because i had this urge to lie on my back on the charles river .  it gets frozen this time of year . 
i can &apos;t believe you wrecked my car .  you &apos;re driving drunk .  it &apos;s pathetic . 
let me drive you home . 
i &apos;m scared .  i want my mommy .  i don &apos;t want to lose you .  i don &apos;t want to lose .  .  . 
you know ,  we &apos;re okay .  they &apos;re not finding us .  you &apos;ll remember me in the morning .  and you &apos;ll come to me and tell me about us and we &apos;ll start over . 
there &apos;s this guy ! 
but can &apos;t you see .  .  .  i love you ,  antoine . 
we did talk about naomi . 
i dropped you off after .  you said  -  - 
i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d show your face around me again .  i figured you were humiliated .  you did run away ,  after all . 
you know what i did . 
this is it ,  joel .  it &apos;s gonna be gone soon . 
but my sleeping is really fucked up . 
what if you stay this time ? 
i don &apos;t know .  what if it breaks ? 
doesn &apos;t sound like me . 
what took you so long ? 
maybe it &apos;s true then .  it &apos;s my voice on the tape . 
look ,  i have to go .  i have to think . 
okay .  i wish you could come . 
so you &apos;re still on the zoloft ? 
clementine . 
bullshit .  who is it ?  you met someone . 
a religion instructor at columbia .  a good guy .  he &apos;s a good guy . 
so i &apos;m going to get some sleep .  i &apos;m glad you &apos;re okay . 
i love quotes .  so did winston churchill .  he actually has a quotation in bartlett &apos;s about bartlett &apos;s .  isn &apos;t that trippy ? 
it &apos;s just .  .  .  y &apos;know .  .  .  i mean .  .  . 
nietzsche .  beyond good and evil .  found it my bartletts . 
what do you want ,  stan ? 
mary .  .  . 
thanks . 
yeah ,  yeah it is ,  howard .  and here i was thinking i could tell you something you didn &apos;t know . 
i tried that already . 
oh ,  hi . 
this book  -  -  it &apos;s essential that people read it because  -  -    -  -  it &apos;s the truth .  and only i know it . 
does that help ? 
she was beautiful .  so sweet and funky and voluptuous .  i kind of stole a pair of her panties ,  is what . 
but unlike the clockworks of the clock people ,  my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe .  .  .  .    .  .  .  .  .  . ha ha ho ho and hee hee . 
what do you believe in then ? 
but that &apos;s an old story now .  .  .  .  .  .  i can &apos;t believe that you would leave the butte . 
you don &apos;t ? 
tell me about it . 
hell no ,  the cranes are wonderful ,  okay ,  but i &apos;m not in this for whooping cranes .  i &apos;m in it for cowgirls .  if we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue ,  then cowgirls become just another compromise .  i want a finer fate than that  -  -  for me and for every other cowgirl .  better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised . 
extraordinary ! 
chink &apos;s the guy &apos;s name ,  for christ &apos;s sake . 
you &apos;re the best ? 
freak ,  schmeek .  most of us are freaks in one way or another .  try being born a male russian countess into a white middle class baptist family in mississippi and you &apos;ll see what i mean . 
if you don &apos;t want me to pose for him ,  why do you want me to meet him ? 
but countess .  .  . 
sissy ,  don &apos;t play dumb with me !  you &apos;re a good model but a shitty actress .  the cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance .  you know perfectly well they are .  last seen in nebraska .  didn &apos;t make it to canada .  siwash lake is between nebraska and canada .  the cowgirls have possession of siwash lake .  and who else but jellybean &apos;s wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds ?  how much do you know about it ?  have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows ? 
that means top - secret ,  cooper . 
you still need the rope ?  i thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins . 
damn ,  dr .  weir ,  don &apos;t scare us like that .  coffee ? 
it was like .  .  .  nothing was there .  .  .  and then justin appeared and the core .  .  .  became metal .  .  . 
what you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion . 
he &apos;s a rescue technician .  peters ,  medical technician .  dj .  .  . 
that ship was lost in deep space ,  seven years ago .  if the titanic sailed into new york harbor ,  i &apos;d find it more plausible .   houston wants aerospace to send out a search and rescue team ,  investigate the source of the transmission .  if it really is the event horizon ,  they &apos;ll attempt a salvage .   we need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship &apos;s systems for the salvage crew .  .  . 
it &apos;s against my better judgement ,  but i &apos;ll run this by the man downstairs .  you &apos;ll know my decision by the end of the day . 
okay .  we do it the hard way .  deck by deck ,  room by room .  starck ,  deploy the umbilicus .  i believe you &apos;re up for a walk ,  mr .  justin .  go get your bonnet on . 
i can understand your desire to redeem your reputation ,  dr .  weir ,  but it doesn &apos;t factor into this . 
since the initial transmission ,  there &apos;s been no further contact .  just the beacon ,  every two minutes . 
what &apos;s the hold up ? 
i put in for a replacement for you but no one .  .  . 
we &apos;ve got pressure . 
that means they didn &apos;t abandon ship . 
justin ,  check the containment for radiation leaks .  peters .  .  . 
yes . 
if it worked . 
explanation ? 
where has it been for the past seven years ? 
maybe you &apos;re right .  but it &apos;s still my command ,  and i have leeway to abort when i feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew .  and i think there is .   starck ,  download all the files from the event horizon &apos;s computers .  coop ,  smith ,  finish moving the co2 scrubbers back onto the clark . 
we &apos;ve got some weather . 
proximity warning !  900 ,  800 meters ,  700 .  .  .  we &apos;re right on top of it ,  we &apos;re gonna hit ! 
captain miller ,  you copy ? 
 .  .  . you break all the laws of physics ,  you think there won &apos;t be a price ?  you already killed the first crew .  .  . 
sir . 
smith ,  get out of there .  .  . 
starck ,  why aren &apos;t you on the bridge ? 
crossing the horizon .  optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees . 
it tastes bad . 
i thought of that ,  with the filters from the clark ,  we &apos;ve got enough breathable air for twenty hours .  after that ,  we &apos;d better be on our way home . 
the event horizon sensors show the same thing :   &quot; bio - readings of indeterminate origin .  &quot;  right before that wave hit the clark ,  there was some kind of surge ,  right off the scale ,  but now it &apos;s back to its previous levels . 
what i want is to survive the next ten hours . 
don &apos;t worry about it .  he &apos;s hard ,  but he &apos;s fair .  you &apos;re lucky to be shipping out with him .  he &apos;s one of the few captains in the service with experience in the outer reach . 
dr .  weir ,  what &apos;s this the door to ? 
yes ,  we can see some kind of mist .  what is that ? 
you got any coffee ? 
where is she ? 
foredecks .  crew quarters ,  bridge ,  medical and science labs ,  hydroponics ,  what have you .  that central section connects the forward decks to the engineering containment area .  can we move in closer ? 
30 hours to neptune orbit . 
the scope is lit ,  it &apos;s right in front of us .  .  . 
range 500 meters and holding .  turbulence is dropping off .  .  . 
claire is your wife ? 
in our current environment ,  dr .  weir ,  self - control is an asset . 
how &apos;d you know it was me ? 
you know ,  you could &apos;a run an ad in the personals . 
we can monitor the cloud &apos;s approach and observe the tests from here . 
you look like an eighties rock band . 
he couldn &apos;t generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass .  yet another mistake for  &quot; mr .  fantastic .  &quot; 
i &apos;ll be watching over you . 
he knew about nasa .  what if he made the call to shut us down  -  - 
no .  i cannot take orders from that underwear model .  that wingnut washed out of nasa for sneaking two victoria secret wannabes into a flight simulator . 
this is your dream ,  reed .  you should be the one up there . 
the shields on the station should protect us . 
i don &apos;t know .  i just keep going over and over the numbers . 
what the  -  -  ! 
ben  -  - 
glad  &quot; nothing &quot;  could take you away from your work . 
i don &apos;t really know .  a compound organic - metallic alloy .  stronger than titanium or carbon steel .  harder than diamonds  -  - 
at this rate ,  the infection should be complete in two ,  maybe three weeks  -  -

it &apos;s not  &quot; invisibility &quot;  per se .  you &apos;re bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field .  that &apos;s what you projected on the bridge . 
okay .  is there any way to duplicate that feeling ?  some memory or .  .  .

was it great ? 
you &apos;ll always remember your first time . 
listen to this .  .  .   &apos;what are your mate &apos;s three most erogenous zones ?  &apos;
wouldn &apos;t penis and balls be the same category ? 
i didn &apos;t ask for any help .  did you ,  linda ? 
what do you think it is ? 
of course it was damone .  if it was ron johnson ,  you &apos;d be out to here ! 
you didn &apos;t tell me that they can be so nice ,  so great .  .  .  but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they &apos;re five years old . 
i really thought he would show up .  i waited .  .  .  and waited .  .  .  and waited .  .  . 
then i called his house ,  and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father . 
sometime ? 
mr .  spicoli ? 
am i hallucinating here ?  just what in the hell do you think you &apos;re doing ? 
you better save some for me ,  you swine !

they &apos;re everywhere .  nobody &apos;s safe .  and sure as hell not in the south .  they like warm weather .  .  .  you &apos;d never believe it .  in l . a .  it &apos;s out of control .  first it was drugs ,  now it &apos;s witchcraft . 
hell ,  no .  we &apos;d never hear the goddamn end of it . 
we know where he lives ,  but we can &apos;t get near the house . 
thanks for the ride .  thanks a lot .  i like you guys .  don &apos;t worry about me . 
we &apos;re your friends .  we &apos;re not like the others . 
where &apos;s the medicine ? 
how long do i have ? 
two cuba libres with beer and mescal on the side .   who &apos;s lacerda ,  he &apos;s waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor ? 
some angry rotarian shoves you and you think :  what &apos;s happening here ?  what &apos;s going on ?  then you hear yourself mumbling . 
yes .  leave the country .  tonight . 
don &apos;t run .  they &apos;d like any excuse to shoot us . 
have you made a deal with him ?  did you put him on to her ? 
you &apos;re doomed .  i &apos;m leaving here in two hours and then they &apos;re going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps .  right there in that tub . 
the cops ? 
okay ,  lucy ,  it &apos;s time to go meet barbra .  .  . 
read the newspapers . 
hell ,  in malibu alone ,  these goddamn satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day .  all they want is the blood .  they &apos;ll take people right off the street if they have to . 
ok ,  goddamnit !  .  .  .  look .  .  .  i &apos;ll call her .  i &apos;ll get her off our backs .  you &apos;re right .  she &apos;s my problem . 
adrenochrome .  .  . 
man ,  your head would swell up like a watermelon ,  you &apos;d probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours .  .  . 
man i &apos;ll try about anything; but i &apos;d never touch a pineal gland . 
don &apos;t take any guff from those swine .  remember ,  if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the right people . 
the dope ring .  you must know what &apos;s going on in this hotel .  why do you think we &apos;re here ? 
maybe she &apos;s telling the truth .  maybe she &apos;s not part of it . 
could i have that ,  please ? 
you can &apos;t keep me here .  this is bullshit .  fuckin &apos; bullshit .  this is fucking bullshit ! 
we &apos;ll meet in three hours ? 
my god damn foot is gone !  who fuckin &apos; shot me ?  who fuckin &apos; shot me !  ? 
well ,  it don &apos;t look pretty . 
i have a cb in my truck ,  we could get some help out here . 
oh ! 
you got something better ? 
that &apos;s the oldest of the bunch ,  looked like the grandpapa .  we caught the little one ,  junior ,  in the cooler there .  as we &apos;ve seen ,  what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed . 
so ,  your husband ditched you ? 
don &apos;t bullshit me !  if you know a way out of this place and you &apos;re holding out  -  - 
hey !  no ,  i &apos;m not trusting him either ,  that &apos;s why you and i will both be going with him . 
this is it !  this is our only way out !  they have this place surrounded .  we go out the front ,  we &apos;re dead .  we go out the back ,  we &apos;re dead ,  but if we go under them .  .  .  we might just make it .   now ,  who else is in ?  seven can go . 
you all sure about this ? 
i &apos;m gonna shoot him if they don &apos;t get him first . 
i &apos;d love to be macho ,  but this is a pants wetter from all angles .

let &apos;s go . 
don &apos;t ! 
are you lying to me ? 
come on ,  it &apos;s just what you need !  let everyone see you .  talk to them ,  live it up ! 
what &apos;re you doing ? 
oh .  i mean ,  good . 
good morning ,  mr .  bebe ! 
society is falling apart ,  miss farmer ,  and people have to buckle down ,  do their jobs .  you see ,  i view myself as the henry ford of motion picture industry ,  and i can &apos;t have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head - lights ,  now can i ? 
yeah ,  i mean slacks .  .  .  and work clothes .  .  .  and that awful car  -  - 
yes ,  but .  .  .  really ,  i hate to sound .  .  .  it &apos;s just that the public expects something different from its stars .  people won &apos;t take you seriously . 
that &apos;s not all ,  frances .  mr .  bebe is very concerned about your politics .  he hears you &apos;ve been donating money ,  speaking at rallies . 
you don &apos;t want to show your whole soul  -  -  ugly ,  mis - shapen ,  and pitiful  -  -  you don &apos;t want to show it  -  - 
a rich actress . 
what does clifford say ? 
cool off ,  beautiful .  didn &apos;t you see the sign says  &quot; dimout zone ?  &quot;   there &apos;s a war on ,  you know ? 
the premiere .  i never pressed you about it but god damn it ,  you &apos;re gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were ! 
 .  .  . i see . 
harry ?  oh harry ,  i knew you &apos;d come .  i love you ,  harry .  i love .  .  .  take me home ,  harry . 
yes ,  yes ,  it &apos;s all arranged .  everyone &apos;s collecting subscriptions in your name .  and the best part is :  the trip returns you to new york . 
it &apos;s already started ,  dad .  .  .  with me . 
but dad ,  i &apos;m asking about me .  what do you think i should do ? 
i &apos;m going back to the hotel . 
why .  .  .  yes . 
gosh !  you &apos;ll break a lot of hearts . 
what ? 
is it true you &apos;re getting a divorce ?  comrade ? 
you know ,  my dad &apos;s done some work for kaminski .  .  . 
honest .  when you were up there ,  you were really .  .  .  there ,  know what i mean ?  everyone else looked stupid . 
yeah ,  it &apos;s a gift .  you gotta do something with it . 
you know ,  my old man was an inventor .  spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads ,  stuff like that .  well ,  i was supposed to be his partner .  when i told him the smell of his workshop made me sick ,  i thought he was going to die right there . 
not bad .  but come on ,  harry; what &apos;s the real reason ? 
oh no .  .  . 
i know what ability you &apos;re interested in . 
serious ,  huh ? 
tell you what .  let &apos;s ditch the limo .  let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up chevy . 
don &apos;t start ,  farmer . 
harry ?  harry ,  where are you ?  ! 
nice joint .  can you afford it ? 
so you drink ,  and you fight with a cop .  .  .  ? 
i should &apos;ve known .  .  . 
what a man ! 
you give up on her ? 
frances ,  you &apos;re crazy . 
anyway .  .  .  if you need me .  .  . 
frances !  frances ! 
frances ,  it &apos;s me ,  harry ? 
c &apos;mere .  i want to talk to you . 
dad ,  too .  i sold the house .  i &apos;m a faceless sinner ,  harry .  .  . 
have you reported to your probation officer as directed ? 
miss farmer ,  is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night ? 
i live here . 
that &apos;s me ,  clifford . 
don &apos;t listen to him ,  little sister .  when you &apos;re proud of what you are ,  you don &apos;t refuse the label ,  understand ? 
it &apos;s okay . 
tell them who i am !  tell them who i am ! 
well ,  they needed immediate answers ,  frances .  it &apos;s good manners and good sense .  you shouldn &apos;t be bothering yourself with these right now . 
nothing .  i think i &apos;ll just go out for awhile . 
i don &apos;t want you drinking ,  frances . 
no ! 
do i go right away or do i have time to take a bath ? 
i find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance . 
thanks are hardly necessary . 
do you expect me ,  for one moment ,  to believe you have greater insight into my personality than i do ? 
you may discuss my predicament ,  doctor .  you may discuss it with anyone you like ,  but not with me .  i &apos;m not interested .  i can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian . 
 .  .  . did you really say that ? 
 .  .  . i &apos;m sorry to keep you waiting ,  the staff review ran over .  did you enjoy your mother &apos;s visit ? 
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll see it my way in the end . 
you &apos;re an outcast . 
come warm yourself if you like . 
more to the point ,  why am i here ?  what did you want with me ?   what does one say to one &apos;s maker ,  having finally met him face to face ?  milton gave it voice .   did i request thee ,  maker ,  from my clay to mould me man ?  did i solicit thee from darkness to promote me ? 
why ,  victor ?  why ?  what were you thinking ? 
what of my soul ?  do i have one ?  or was that a part you left out ?   who were these people of which i am comprised ?  good people ?  bad people ? 
friend ? 
get away from her !  she &apos;s mine ! 
that &apos;s the nature of all progress ,  william .  don &apos;t let your brother sway you otherwise . 
elizabeth ,  really !  he &apos;s quite mad ! 
nothing .  still nothing . 
have you seen willie ? 
our decision .  together . 
what sort of task ? 
i remember the first time i ever saw you .  crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side .  so beautiful even then . 
victor ! 
i &apos;m convinced .  not by treating symptoms ,  but by diving nature &apos;s most jealously - guarded secrets . 
 .  .  . yes ,  and thanks to him ,  smallpox has been virtually eliminated .  i &apos;ve heard this speech before . 
they &apos;ll hang him all the same . 
keep your voice down .  you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re saying . 
you &apos;re making a scene ! 
we catch a few hours sleep where we can .  usually here at your bedside . 
yes .  i took refuge in the barn .  wouldn &apos;t you ?  lost in the storm ?  freezing and wet ?  i was exhausted and could search no longer . 
philosophical ? 
paracelsus ? 
what is your name ? 
electricity . 
re - configure the leads ? 
your men are right to be afraid . 
you &apos;d persist at the cost of your own life ?  the lives of your crew ? 
the killer is still out there . 
melvin belli . 
good night ,  alice . 
cabin b is ready . 
oh ,  my god .  .  . 
you can only do what you can do . 
i &apos;ll go check on brenda . 
i &apos;ll be along . 
i wouldn &apos;t know . 
give me a hand ? 
you just had some lucky shots . 
holy shit .  .  . 
what about the dope paragraph in mr .  christy &apos;s letter ? 
wind &apos;s up .  it &apos;s shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees . 
he keeps on acting like such an asshole ! 
bad enough we got a full moon; it &apos;s friday the 13th .  they keep statistics .  we get more accidents ,  more robberies ,  more rapes ,  more homicides ,  more of everything when there &apos;s a full moon .  it affects people .  makes  &apos;em nuts . 
you said it was just you and your son . 
whatsamatter with you ?  are you crazy ? 
oh ,  seth ,  how can i ever make it up to you ? 
you like the car ? 
it &apos;s hardly been used at all .  i got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years .  swear to god .  that &apos;s like new . 
what are you gonna do ? 
have you forgotten about your sister ? 
okay ,  i &apos;ll kill you when you change ,  i swear to god in jesus christ &apos;s name . 
where is the little lady ? 
you &apos;re a preacher ? 
didn &apos;t think so .  so ,  as i was saying ,  i &apos;m willing to make a deal .  you behave ,  get us into mexico ,  and don &apos;t try to escape .  i &apos;ll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning . 
swear to god ,  on the bible ,  you won &apos;t try to escape and you &apos;ll get us across the border . 
i don &apos;t have the slightest idea . 
what did you call me ? 
well ,  i say lets tear this place apart for weapons .  so when they burst through that door ,  we &apos;ll make  &apos;em wish they never did . 
i promise . 
it &apos;s the bitterest of pills . 
i didn &apos;t want to talk about this in front of scott because he gets upset .  but you don &apos;t believe in god anymore ? 
it &apos;s just ,  all our lives you &apos;ve been a pastor .  for twenty years you &apos;ve preached trust in the lord .  and then one day you wake up and say fuck him ? 
what &apos;s going on ? 
watch my back ! 
how many bullets left ,  kid ? 
why ,  just look at all this .  you got your kitchen  -  - 
not even for lunch ? 
what the fuck is wrong with you  -  - 
start the car . 
gotcha ! 
no .   that woman wouldn &apos;t of said shit if she had a mouthful . 
this isn &apos;t gonna work . 
what does that mean ? 
i &apos;m curious .  what was the nuttiest thing i did ? 
far out .   where are my glasses ? 
i &apos;m lookin &apos; scared ? 
you know what you look like ? 
because i was civil ,  now you &apos;re complaining . 
straight up ? 
fine by me ,  sir ! 
i ain &apos;t gonna shoot her . 
yes ? 
 &quot; coronado .  &quot; 
did you set me up ?   did you set me up just to see me fail ? 
so she picks the women ,  we pick the programs .   seals ? 
what the hell is the president trying to do ?   steal dehaven &apos;s thunder ? 
so it really has nothing to do with actual brain size ? 
well ,  flea ,  i appreciate the respect you just showed me .   but i don &apos;t need it and don &apos;t want it  -  -  not that kind of respect ,  anyway .   it &apos;s just gonna hurt us both ,  okay ? 
boat five  -  -  wickwire ,  cozad ,  vinyl ,  intagliata ,  ayers ,  and wise .  lieutenant wickwire is your senior officer .   follow his orders to your death . 
you don &apos;t think she &apos;d be raped if she were captured ?   you don &apos;t think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men ? 
she &apos;s an officer .   there &apos;s a higher standard . 
i &apos;ll try to keep the door open .   if you wash out ,  i make it so that  -  - 
i don &apos;t feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life ,  jordan .   maybe we should just let it happen . 
sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth .   but i &apos;m trying to be honest ,  okay ?   three years is a long time .   don &apos;t ask me to predict how i &apos;ll feel then ,  jordan ,  because i don &apos;t know .   and either do you . 
well ,  not this .   i was doing the pentagon scene few nights ago .   got some fresh stuff  -  -  about you .   you may be in a hostile camp .   i think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn . 
instructors typically pull three year assignments .   this guy &apos;s in and out in one year  -  -  your year .   that sound right ? 
so here we are again .   staring three years of operational duty in the face . 
wick .   they got your crew ,  too ? 
so the shit you gotta go through ?  to get from here to there ?   brother said it was worth it .   worth the training .  .  .  worth the divorce .  .  .  worth anything . 
at first . 
first big night of liberty and no date ?   you &apos;re pathetic ,  wickwire . 
simple question ,  lieutenant .   no reason not to answer .   what is your father &apos;s name ? 
any brothers ?   sisters ? 
you are in the cage ,  o &apos;neil .   right here ,  right now . 
why didn &apos;t you shoot the woman ,  o &apos;neil ? 
we &apos;re fucked . 
you mind ?   i &apos;m trying to eat here . 
if you were the president ,  wouldn &apos;t that put a little piss in your shoes ? 
who the hell are all these people ? 
me !  ?  you where the one .  .  . 
how long where you and dis guy goin &apos; steady ? 
yeah .  why are you asking ? 
you &apos;re a reporter .  that &apos;s what you always wanted to be ,  right ?  i &apos;m happy for you .  really ,  i am . 
wait .  i &apos;m sorry .  you &apos;re right .  eight years is a long time .  can i offer you a cup of tea ? 
you never said it was off the record . 
circuits are overloaded . 
come on ,  the broadcast booth is right over here . 
the network is on an intranet .  it &apos;s a direct feed into our computer system . 
my life sucks . 
what the hell are you doing ? 
your old sweetheart ? 
wish me luck ! 
the warm feeling of helping your fellow man . 
just tell me ,  did you talk with him ? 
i can &apos;t . 
caiman ,  wait .  take me with you . 
hi .  nick tatopoulos .  .  . 
three years digging up worms in chernobyl ?  how did mrs .  tatopoulos handle it ? 
hence the radiation . 
evacuate manhattan ?  that &apos;s over three million people .  has that ever been done before ? 
they will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten . 
and how should we do that ,  sir ? 
look ,  i may work for the nuclear regulatory commission but accidents and spills are not my field . 
what sample ? 
the radiation is not an anomaly ,  it &apos;s the clue .  this creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur . 
no ,  it reproduces asexually .  that &apos;s why we must find the nest .  if we don &apos;t ,  dozens will be born ,  each one capable of laying eggs of its own .  very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population . 
general anderson ,  the problem was the terrain .  if we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of central park .  .  .   we should be able to take him down . 
they &apos;ve turned off the ventilation system .  they &apos;re calling him to dinner . 
what &apos;d they say ? 
dr .  lazarus .  .  .  i hope that i &apos;m not breaching protocol but .  .  i am so very humbled to stand in your presence .  .  .  i have studied your missions extensively .  .  .  though i am thermian ,  i have lived my life by your philosophy ,  by the code of the mak &apos;tar . 
dr .  lazarus ,  here is your surface mapper .   i have programed it to the coordinates of a beryllium sphere of sufficient density . 
good luck on your mission ,  sir .  by grabthar &apos;s hammer ,  by the suns of warvan i wish you - 
we &apos;ve got to stop ! 
go ahead ! 
 &quot; purple skinned monstrosity .  .  .  ?  &quot; 
~hex !   alex ,  are you okav ? 
not again .  .  . 
could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one ! 
what &apos;s happened ? 
and note the sucked in gut . 
we heard it the first time ! 
back there .  you said  &quot; the commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals .  &quot; 
i have sectors 1 - 28 .   i think hector has the upper levels . 
 .  .  .  yes ? 
oh .  .  .  oh ,  i see .  oh . 
yes ,  i know ,  and i want you to know i thought about what you said .  .  .  i know you meant it constructively but .  .  . 
 .  .  .  but i want you to know that i am not a complete braincase ,  okay ?  i understand completely that it &apos;s just a tv show .  there is no ship ,  there is no beryllium sphere ,  no diagital conveyor .  .  .  i mean ,  obviously it &apos;s all just a - 
yes .  .  .  ? 
brandon .  .  just in case i die ,  there &apos;s something i have to know .  .  . 
what does the omega 13 do ? 
but you don &apos;t ? 
brandon !  time to go ! 
the ship is sustaining structural damage . 
computer ,  what about our engines ?  why don &apos;t we have power ? 
you okay ,  alex ? 
we &apos;ve got to get that valve turned off .  their oxygen is almost gone .  .  . 
that &apos;s why you built this ship ? 
where are the miners ? 
oh ,  they &apos;re so cute . 
i am so sick of being right . 
they &apos;re still behind us .  .  . 
that &apos;s it ,  that &apos;s what &apos;s going to kill me . 
they &apos;re gone . 
you have no idea what a perimeter is ,  do you ? 
well you have to tell them .   what if something happens ?  we &apos;re actors ,  not astronauts .  .  .  we can &apos;t do this stuff ! 
there &apos;s nobody here .  jason .  .  . 
all right ,  now nobody panic ,  i &apos;ve dealt with this guy before and believe me ,  he &apos;s as stupid as he is ugly . 
maybe we can lose them in that cloud . 
are they behind us ? 
wait ,  the pig lizard is gone .  why are they still chanting for the pig lizard ? 
jason ?  .  .  .   i don &apos;t think the pig lizard was gorignak .  .  . 
where the hell is he ?   an hour and a half late .   an hour and a half ! 
you should have let me hit him . 
my name is jason nesmith .  i &apos;m an actor .  we &apos;re all actors . 
commander ?  .  .  .  where are you .  .  .  going ? 
how can we thank you ,  commander .  you -  you have saved our people . 
mathesar ?  .   .  .  has sarris seen the .  .  historical records ? 
commander .  .  . 
a thousand apologies .  we have failed you . 
the ship is a model .  .  .  as big as this !  .  .  .  a very clever deception indeed !  he oan &apos;t oontaln his lauchter .   a belle -  -  -  -  - tommy set a course for home ,  lommander ? 
well ,  it &apos;s .  .  .  this was a device we .  .  .   discovered on an alien planet .   we don &apos;t know what it does either . 
enerao ,  i &apos;ve host them .  the maanetlsm o :  the field is disrupting our onstru -  ~ait .  there they are
what ?  wh
i &apos;m accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property . 
they &apos;re ready .   believe me ,  the ones that stayed on here at valley forge are ready for anything .   of course ,  we get nothing from congress .   they need boots ,  coats .  .  .  we desperately need food . 
there was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at congress which says i am personally responsible for all our hardships .   and .  .  .  that i have encouraged the people of america to make me into a god !   benedict ,  it says that i have gone mad ! 
these men were taken from their homes at night ,  tried by reed &apos;s courts  -  -  which congress recognizes  -  -  and ,  well ,  you can see . 
yes ,  general .   but if you have to shoot somebody ,  you can &apos;t . 
wil .  .  . 
you &apos;ve served me loyally ,  year after year ,  without complaining .  i &apos;ve thought hard about you this past winter .   i want to free you ,  wil .   i want to give you your freedom ,  after this battle is fought . 
well ,  what have you thought ? 
what sort of boots would you say he &apos;s wearing ?   i should say ,  no sort of boots at all .   aren &apos;t those rags wrapped around his feet ?   is that what he marched here in ? 
negroes ?   washington has black men in his army ?   are they good fighters ?   what &apos;s that red ribbon on his arm ,  colonel ? 
who is that !  ? 
how old are you ,  captain ? 
i &apos;m so inclined . 
are you going to keep him ,  sir ? 
it &apos;s impossible to stop these men deserting in winter ,  you might as well stop geese from migrating . 
have you decided if you are going to join the virginia delegation to the constitutional convention ? 
horatio !   horatio gates ,  of course you know john adams of the massachusetts delegation . 
you think that ? 
partially .  .  . 
congress is bitterly opposed to allowing negroes in the army ! 
colonel reed .  .  . 
that damned arnold is here ,  isn &apos;t he ?   did you know he lost all his ships ?   outrageous and completely unacceptable . 
george ,  i &apos;m afraid if you go through with this madness i must tender my resignation as your aide .  i see where we &apos;re headed ,  you &apos;re putting your trust in the likes of hamilton and arnold .  .  . 
gentlemen ,  let me get to the point ,  i can &apos;t see the wisdom of pursuing this old court - martial against general arnold . 
sir ,  please accept my commission from congress .  .  .  and .  .  .   you must see this portrait of my beautiful wife ,  adrienne ,  we had the most perfect little baby girl just before i left .   her name is henriette .  .  . 
 &apos;charming little victories ?  &apos; please don &apos;t expect much more of us ,  monsieur . 
these supplies .  .  .  ? 
and how rusty are these muskets ? 
because ,  if the british got off their asses and came up here ,  now ,  we would be smashed .   and the revolution would be finished .   tell king louis ,  it &apos;s that bad . 
well ,  a very real expectation is the british will hang you !   they &apos;ll burn mount vernon and they &apos;ll hang you !   our marriage is a business just as surely as .  .  . 
but ,  as usual ,  it will not go well for .  .  .  them .   martha ,  you must trust me . 
what &apos;s the point of a revolution if it doesn &apos;t ? 
we can &apos;t take them .   are you all right ? 
what the hell are we doing ? 
nathanael ,  i &apos;m sending you to virginia to head the southern army ,  to harass cornwallis .   marquis ,  you must go with him . 
well ,  this must be about something ! 
now that is a lie !   see how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet !   when you break off your engagement to martha curtis ,  i &apos;ll divorce william !   do you hear ?   you get what you want from this world ,  then throw it all away on love ! 
we can grow three primary crops in a season and ,  if we have some luck ,  we get a forth .   the temperature is generally mild . 
then why are you teaching me .  .  .  ? 
i always though london was the place to be :   capital of the world ,  the most spectacular city on earth . 
i &apos;ve been surprised in an unguarded hour ,  but must not now go back; the love that lay ,  half smothered in my breast ,  has broke through all ,  its weak restraints ,  and burns in its full lustre .   i cannot ,  if i would ,  conceal it from thee . 
and i mean high up in it .   that &apos;s why harry &apos;s gonna make mr .  lovejoy with me ,  not chili palmer . 
i guess still in the locker . 
his foot .  jeez ,  poor ronnie .  .  . 
listen ,  tonight ,  later on ,  i got one for you doesn &apos;t involve any heavy work .  i want you to go have a look around chili palmer &apos;s hotel room . 
who ? 
he &apos;s gonna plea - deal his way out .  give up this ace stunt man now one of the west coast dope kings ,  if they go easy on the cat . 
what ,  the setup didn &apos;t work so you want the key back ? 
where is my nephew ? 
maybe your nephew panicked ,  took off . 
says here you &apos;re getting martin weir for the part of lovejoy . 
i &apos;m working on a few things . 
listen ,  harry ,  how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand ?  you pay me back at your convenience ,  no interest . 
he was watching letterman ,  huh ?  sneaky ,  that chili palmer .   so ,  he ever find this dry cleaner ,  the one with all that money on him ? 
yeah ?  well ,  trust me .  i &apos;m very for real . 
harry zimm .  the man happens to be a major hollywood player . 
so ,  what ,  this zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee ,  that what we &apos;re talking about here ? 
you say look at you ? 
sovereign . 
get in line ,  bro . 
tough shit ,  bro .  this ain &apos;t miami .  you want something ,  talk to me . 
that &apos;s the idea .  i &apos;ll think about it . 
i &apos;m looking at you . 
dick allen &apos;s a very dear friend of mine .  how far you want to go with this ? 
come on ,  harry  -  mesas ?  the worst they might do is get a judgment against you ,  uttering a bad check .  i can &apos;t imagine you want that to happen ,  man in your position . 
you want to hear this idea ?  it &apos;s about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand .  go on ,  tell her . 
that &apos;s half a movie ,  with holes in it .  maybe forty minutes of screen time .  you don &apos;t even have a girl ,  a female lead ,  and on top of that ,  there &apos;s no one to sympathize with ,  you don &apos;t have a good guy . 
you pack a gun ? 
these guys ,  my investors ,  they run a limo service ,  came to me originally ,  put money in a few of my pictures and did okay ,  they &apos;re happy .  so they come in on another deal  -  this was back a few months ago when i was planning what would be my next picture ,  about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake .  the characters ,  there &apos;s this seven -  hundred - pound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys ,  gets them in her trailer  - 
you got that on the brain ,  harry .  if you &apos;re so scared of  &apos;em why &apos;d you take their money to vegas to begin with ? 
one of his best parts . 
doris ,  murray &apos;s widow ,  finds out about this martin weir thing and says since murray and i never had any written contract ,  she wants five hundred grand for the script . 
what do you get out of this ? 
here &apos;s your keys ,  harry . 
ray barboni .  guy from miami ,  owns leo now that momo died . 
so you don &apos;t know what i &apos;m thinking . 
how about this ? 
you &apos;ve been losing . 
we call you a taxi . 
the interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand ? 
no ,  no .  .  .  you left the patio door open .  you gotta stop doin &apos; that ,  all the nice things you got around here . 
rough day on the set ? 
i know i &apos;m better than what i &apos;ve been doing the last ten years ,  walking around in a tank top and fuck - me pumps ,  waiting till it &apos;s time to scream . 
i got you a copy of the script . 
i don &apos;t know ,  i &apos;m just havin &apos; some trouble seeing you two together . 
no .  i don &apos;t mean that .  i just meant in general . 
why not ? 
you sure ? 
i hate to say i told you ,  but i did .  i told you don &apos;t start nothing with him that time . 
no ,  you just broke his fuckin &apos; nose instead . 
all i know is he came by the barber shop ,  all fuckin &apos; undone ,  wanting to know where you were staying in vegas .  i told him i don &apos;t know .  i still don &apos;t . 
what &apos;re you talking about ?  you wanna be a movie star ? 
yeah ,  but whose point of view ? 
what i &apos;m saying ,  harry ,  is i want you and your new buddy to get out of my house . 
harry ,  what &apos;re you still doing with those guys ? 
which two ? 
oh ,  for christ &apos;s sake  - 
affirmative ,  arctic warrior .  what type of vessel ? 
hear that ,  dodge ?  epps don &apos;t think it &apos;s a problem . 
what &apos;s so great about sweden ? 
fifty million dollars .  fifty million .  we gonna let this guy just take it from us ?  one guy ? 
pretty handy with that scatter gun ,  epps .  you raised on a farm ? 
i &apos;m no doctor .  but i &apos;d say he &apos;s in a coma . 
try wednesday . 
did you ? 
what the hell would a freighter be doing up here ?  it &apos;s way out of the lanes .  there &apos;s not a port for 800 miles . 
yeah ,  from one side of the harbor to the other .  but we got half the bering sea and the whole alaskan gulf to drag her over . 
with a little extra fuel ,  weather permitting ,  we should make sitka in five days without another stop . 
mother fucker ! 
the number one turbine &apos;s pretty well trashed .  number two runs ,  but it &apos;s way underpowered . 
i thought you said it was just a blade . 
went aboard . 
it &apos;s a hell of a lot of money . 
yeah ,  yeah .  i &apos;m on it . 
if he &apos;s reasonable ,  maybe we can make some kind of deal .  if not .  we &apos;ll have to re - consider our options . 
bodies &apos;re too fresh . 
dodge to murphy . 
so .  i got a question .  just from a ,  you know ,  purely technical standpoint .  we call the coastguard .   coastguard shows up .  what exactly is the plan ? 
yeah ,  well .  the truth is one thing .  when there &apos;s more than a few hundred million dollars involved ,  that &apos;s a whole new deal . 
i think you know . 
the radio ! 
what the fuck  -  -   ? 
i don &apos;t figure there &apos;s much i want money can &apos;t buy . 
tomorrow we &apos;ll see if we can &apos;t find some line and tackle .  use some of those bodies below decks for bait . 
could be a fishing boat . 
i can &apos;t believe you .  dodge &apos;s dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share . 
candy ? 
go on . 
maybe they didn &apos;t want it back .  maybe the whole fat deal was insured . 
what guy ? 
are you sure ? 
no cowboy shit up there ,  understand ? 
murphy to epps . 
you &apos;re saying they mutinied for the gold ? 
 &quot; the crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill .  &quot; 
what do you think happened on this boat ? 
no .  i think they are ,  were ,  just passengers .  innocent victims . 
something bad happened here ,  murphy . 
over the gold . 
what ? 
greer to murphy . 
call the coastguard ? 
it &apos;s funny . 
if they thought it was lost at sea ,  they probably just wrote it off . 
yeah ,  but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to sitka . 
fifty million four ways .  that &apos;s twelve million and change a piece .   what you gonna do with your share ,  skipper ? 
i say we off - load some of that gold now . 
ho - ly shit . 
greek citizen .  merchant navy .   obviously we aren &apos;t the first to come across this ship .  they probably stumbled across it just like we did . 
maybe epps &apos;s mystery man had something to do with it . 
what happened ? 
oh ,  man . 
he took the shotgun and a light . 
can &apos;t find the shotgun . 
as i said ,  what seems to be the trouble ? 
i thought you say tuesday . 
have you seen my blue spatula ? 
give up ? 
well ,  maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at computer station .  normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience ,  but she thinks she can convince them . 
pumpkin ,  are you in there ? 
was it bosnia ?  i forget .  .  .   it &apos;s so sad ,  the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy .   a soul / funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention .  she goes over and turns it up . 
uh ,  well ,  that &apos;s okay  -  i don &apos;t dance ,  heh ,  heh .  .  . 
i - i honestly never intended for this to happen .  .  . 
and what can you tell us about this .  .  .  
and how does an image like this help us to see that ? 
hmm . 
i dunno .  .  .  would i have to take classes and stuff ? 
what are you doing ?  you don &apos;t ever criticize the feature ! 
why do you even need a ride ?  you could walk there in two minutes . 
yeah ,  right . 
that &apos;s not him .  .  .  jesus ,  stop freaking me out . 
yeah ,  well  -  - 
just think ,  we &apos;ll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again . 
shut up ! 
hi . 
what do you do if you &apos;re a satanist ,  anyway ? 
does oomie really like this show ? 
look at how cute i am ! 
i want to  &quot; make love &quot;  to him . 
it &apos;s obviously him ! 
what should we do ?  what if he recognizes us ? 
ew ,  look at this .  .  . 
not really .  .  . 
what ?  how long have you been standing there ? 
where are we going ? 
there he is .  .  . 
i &apos;ll bet he never jerks off .  .  . 
why are we going here ?  i hate this place . 
it &apos;s a surprise . 
i totally ,  totally hate you . 
 .  .  . you don &apos;t have to make a million dollars  -  -  just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment . 
you &apos;re just jealous . 
anyway ,  now we can start looking for the apartment .  .  .   do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment ? 
what are you talking about ?  what kind of loser gets fired after one day ?  ! 
if it makes you feel any better ,  i don &apos;t think you could &apos;ve gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff . 
i am not  -  -  i just think it &apos;d be funny to see what he &apos;d do .  .  . 
look ,  we have to get these .  .  . 
i &apos;m sick of waiting  -  we need to start getting stuff if we &apos;re ever going to move .   aren &apos;t these the greatest towels ? 
how repulsive ! 
so ,  whaddya think ? 
oh my god ,  you guys !  i can &apos;t believe we made it ! 
it &apos;s really quite something to see you all grown up like this ,  enid .   i &apos;d love to hear about what you &apos;re doing .  i can &apos;t help but feel that i had some small part in how you turned out .  .  .   what are you studying ?  you were always such a smart little girl . 
how much is this ? 
don &apos;t mind me ,  i &apos;ll just be in my room . 
fine ,  and how are you ? 
tsk !  you jews are so clever with money .  .  . 
god ,  look at this poster !   i can &apos;t believe this room !  you &apos;re the luckiest guy in the world !  i &apos;d kill to have stuff like this ! 
no really .  .  .  i guarantee i could get you a date in like two seconds .  .  . 
c &apos;mon seymour ,  i &apos;m trying to collect data here !  don &apos;t you want me to find you your perfect dream girl ? 
we need to narrow this down somehow .  .  .  we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests . 
uh ,  i don &apos;t have much money with me right now . 
so ,  i don &apos;t really get it  -  -  are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this ? 
yeah ,  well ,  you &apos;re not the only one .  everybody i know has totally fucked up problems .  .  .  it seems like only stupid people have good relationships .  .  . 
never .  .  . 
aren &apos;t you going to get that ? 
no ,  actually joe told me you were here .  .  .  so how come you never call me anymore ? 
yeah ,  i &apos;ll bet !  so ,  how &apos;s it going with what &apos;s - her - name ?  dana ? 
so ,  what kind of stuff do you guys do together ?  is she into old records and stuff ? 
well forget the art show .  .  .  let &apos;s do something else . 
oh ,  uh .  .  .  they were a present from dana . 
no ,  of course i do .  .  .  it &apos;s just that right now i need to  -  - 
i don &apos;t know .  .  .  i &apos;m sorry ,  but dana &apos;s a very jealous person .  i just don &apos;t want to screw that up right now .  .  .  i &apos;m sure she &apos;ll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends .  .  . 
what &apos;s the matter ? 
that &apos;s dana &apos;s  -  i &apos;m supposed to be saving it for our two - month anniversary .  you better not  -  - 
you know what we should do ?  let &apos;s go get in your car right now and just take off !  we could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life .  .  .  fuck everybody ! 
i &apos;ll drive ,  then  -  -  we &apos;ll go out in a blaze of glory ! 
yeah ,  well .  .  .  me neither .  .  . 
i was just thinking out loud .  .  .   i mean ,  you &apos;ve got this whole thing with dana  -  -  i &apos;m not going to let you fuck that up .  .  . 
what do we have here ,  margaret ? 
i can see that .  .  .  now what can you tell us about it ?  first of all ,  what kind of sculpture is this ? 
no .  .  .  they said she was here .  .  . 
uh ,  do you mind if i wait ?  i really need to talk to her . 
seymour ? 
let me see the sick . 
starting now ,  we attack them . 
it hasn &apos;t been that simple so far . 
this is supposed to be salvation ?   what kind of idiocy are we dealing with here ? 
understand ,  i had help - 
silliest thing i ever heard of -  why in the world should we go through all that ? 
i have been desperate for patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived . 
finish your tour ? 
i &apos;ve never been all that adventurous .  i wouldn &apos;t be in the way ? 
i hate to be a bother ,  john ,  but the cramp &apos;s getting worse .   the pain is actually quite unbearable now . 
second death ?  where ?  - 
actually ,  no . 
have you got it ? 
it &apos;s certainly the best chance they &apos;ve had to kill you . 
it &apos;s all wonderfully under control ,  samuel -  you &apos;ve done a splendid job . 
soon .  
why do you laugh ?  -  you don &apos;t believe she taught me ? 
oh ,  yes ,  i got in a little late this morning ,  janosz . 
every day i ask you ,  and every day you &apos;ve got something else to do .   do i have bad breath or something ? 
okay ,  just thought i &apos;d check .   good night ,  dana .   sleep well .   don &apos;t let the bedbugs bite you . 
time is running out ,  dana .   soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine  -  -  and vigo &apos;s .   well ,  mainly vigo &apos;s .   but we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship . 
occasionally
men are very sensitive ,  you know .   we need to feel loved and desired ,  too . 
peter ,  this is serious .   i need to know if you think there &apos;s anything unusual about him . 
i &apos;ll do it . 
brings back a lot of sweet memories ,  doesn &apos;t it ?   there &apos;s our old cash machine .   and the dry cleaners we used to go to .   and the old video store .   we really had some good times ,  didn &apos;t we ? 
that &apos;s where the buggy stopped . 
who could blame him ?   were you wearing this nightgown ? 
this is joe namath &apos;s old number ,  you know .  you could get a lot of chicks with this .  just don &apos;t pee in it . 
are you all squeaky clean now ? 
i &apos;m not here to date .   i can &apos;t leave oscar in a strange place with someone i don &apos;t know . 
does she know anything about babies ? 
so  -  -  are you making any new year &apos;s resolutions ? 
all right ,  you want to be real ?   so tell me why did you dump me ? 
maybe i should call janine . 
i think he likes you .   i think i do too . 
that &apos;s a terrible thing to say . 
i was trying to get that smelly green thing .  the guys asked me to help out .   i &apos;m like the fifth ghostbuster . 
well ,  good night ,  louis . 
it &apos;s really not a bad place .   it just needs a woman &apos;s touch . 
should we go ? 
we don &apos;t go around altering valuable paintings ,  dr .  venkman . 
you pitiful ,  miserable creatures !   you dare to challenge the power of darkness ?   don &apos;t you realize what you are dealing with ?   he &apos;s vigo !   you are like the buzzing of flies to him . 
i ,  vigo ,  the scourge of carpathia ,  the sorrow of moldavia ,  command you . 
you &apos;ve got to do something ! 
these boys aren &apos;t playing around . 
i &apos;ll ask you again ,  dr .  venkman .   why were you digging the hole ?   and please remember that you &apos;re under oath . 
how &apos;ve you been ?   how &apos;s teaching ?   i bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours ,  huh ? 
you know ,  animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters .   given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population . 
pretty impressive ,  huh ? 
i &apos;m egon  -  - 
six feet  -  -  seven  -  -  eight  -  - 
we &apos;ve found it at every event site we &apos;ve been to lately . 
there &apos;s definitely something going on in that studio .   the pke levels were max - plus and the giga - meter was showing all red . 
who ? 
who ?   who ?   who ? 
oh good ,  you &apos;re here .   spengler and i have something really amazing to show you . 
i &apos;ll keep to the middle of the channel .  we &apos;re okay to 59th street ,  then we &apos;ll go ashore and take first avenue to 79th . 
that &apos;s it ,  ray .   i &apos;ve had it .   no more parties .  i &apos;m tired of taking abuse from over - privileged nine - year - olds . 
give it up ,  ray .   you &apos;re living in the past .  ghostbusters doesn &apos;t exist anymore .   in a year these kids won &apos;t even remember who we are . 
does it have any favorites ? 
are you all right ? 
nice going ,  ray !   what were you trying to do  -  -  drown me ? 
she &apos;s moving ! 
kind of makes you wonder ,  doesn &apos;t it ? 
oh ,  dana ,  it &apos;s you  .  .  . 
we &apos;re all professionals here ,  miss  .  .  . 
you play the cello !   it &apos;s my favorite instrument . 
i &apos;d have to say prokofiev &apos;s third concerto . 
i want to help you . 
all right .   since you put it that way . 
he is the destructor . 
right  .  .  .  you &apos;re the gatekeeper .   but i want dana .   dana ,  speak to me  .  .  . 
this is going to cost you ,  you know .   our fees are ridiculously high . 
i trust you &apos;re moving us to a better space somewhere on campus . 
you have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street . 
did you see it ?   what was it ? 
egon ,  there &apos;s something very strange about that man .   i &apos;m very psychic usually and right now i have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you .   i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re going to die . 
keep it anyway .   i have another one at home . 
and someone from the epa is here to see you . 
thank you for coming so quickly .   the guests are starting to ask questions and i &apos;m running out of excuses . 
i see .   and now you catch ghosts ? 
have it your way ,  mr .  venkman . 
at ease ,  officers .   i &apos;m peter venkman .   i think there &apos;s been some kind of misunderstanding here and i want to cooperate in every way i can . 
the man is a psychopath ,  your honor . 
nervous ? 
well ,  just 75 more to go .   what &apos;s this one ? 
hey !   i &apos;m getting a little tired of this . 
did you see anything ? 
wait !   wait !   there &apos;s something i forgot to tell you . 
you talked to gozer ? 
on the count of three !   one  .  .  .  two  .  .  . 
sorry ,  buddy ! 
excuse me for a minute .   ray ,  i &apos;m right in the middle of something here .   can you come back in about an hour ? 
what is it ? 
anything !   just make contact . 
you said you floored  &apos;em at the regents &apos; meeting . 
this is like a major disgrace .   forget m . i . t .  or stanford now  .  .  .  they wouldn &apos;t touch us with a three - meter cattle prod . 
you &apos;ll never regret this ,  ray . 
why don &apos;t i check out the building ?   it may have a history of psychic turbulence . 
ray  -  -  something &apos;s here . 
it &apos;s here ,  ray .   it &apos;s looking at me . 
are you a christian ,  ray ? 
do you believe in god ? 
right .   and the sky would fall  .  .  . 
quite so .   narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve rome .  .  . 
the army is a problem .   they love you .   you have led them from victory to victory in the name of rome and they love you .   and after all ,  you &apos;re just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty  -  -  who could fault you for that ?   thus have i reached a compromise with the senate over your fate :  instead of executing you ,  i &apos;m sending you to rome where you will be tried .  .  . 
caesar ,  ignore them . 
and like children everywhere they scream  &quot; freedom &quot;  the most when they desire it least .   i beg you ,  please continue ,  caesar . 
so am i . 
caesar ,  let me sponsor your first wager in the arena . 
we must obey our emperor and the senate . 
cos ,  what in hades is the emperor up to ?   and don &apos;t tell me you don &apos;t know ! 
agh !   please !   he &apos;s having a secret device constructed for the circus .  the brass craftsmen are working overtime . 
i &apos;ve read of it . 
i would venture ,  with all respect :  the emperor &apos;s health is the business of every soul in the empire . 
you &apos;re a citizen and a soldier .   not a gladiator . 
you know our two most senior senators :   gaius cantus and falco verus ? 
without him .   he &apos;d be weeping if he overheard that .   well ?   the idea of you as my adopted brother is very .  .  .  exciting . 
it &apos;s my brother &apos;s neck you want ,  not mine . 
marcus would have lived but .  .  .  was poisoned by his son . 
commodus ,  it &apos;s we who are going on the offensive . 
the senators admire you . 
what the hell was all that about ? 
it &apos;s your job as a roman officer to disobey such a summons . 
he &apos;s very realistic . 
well ,  you wanted the girls to have the best teachers . 
what about their philosophy lessons ? 
the battle is over .   the war is over .   you &apos;ve won ! 
narcissus ! 
i &apos;ll never die .   you tell the girls that .   you honor our ancestors and i &apos;ll be there .   every night .   at the table of life . 
who the hell are you ? 
condemned ?   aren &apos;t i owed a trial before being condemned ? 
death is a very light thing for you . 
sorry but i have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise i won &apos;t even get back the cost of the bribe i had to pay the arena slaves to get you here .   i know what you &apos;re trying to do :   kill yourself and trust in the roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands .   the only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you &apos;re a very important individual .   you make me feel good about my investment !   and that puking pig jerses  -  -  he won &apos;t even discuss you .   both of you have clamped mouths !   but i love all my fighters  -  -  i &apos;ll find out about your family .   and about you .   that i promise . 
you get to come alive again in the country ! 
then get a large cash advance . 
before they leave ,  get gold . 
so ,  things change .   the government has moved to the circus .   you &apos;re going to fight last .   and commodus is going to fight first . 
hello . 
do you want some dinner ? 
i want to go home . 
what ? 
listen  -  -  could you stop crying ,  please ? 
would you like to come in ?  i could make some coffee . 
why aren &apos;t you ready ? 
what is it ? 
what ? 
don &apos;t cry .  
but you &apos;re not enrolled . 
i don &apos;t understand  -  - 
she said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend .  you waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night . 
then you took her upstairs and you raped her . 
can i just sit here while you &apos;re packing ? 
don &apos;t you have it on ? 
we just can . 
who  -  -  that guy at the zoo ? 
well ,  what did he say ?  i &apos;m curious . 
oh .   well  -  -  i &apos;m not sure  -  -  but you might try the first presbyterian .  that &apos;s on allan street . 
what are you then ? 
see  -  -  she &apos;s just having some water .  now there &apos;s no need for the cops or anything . 
benjamin ? 
come to the railing and i &apos;ll hand it up . 
i &apos;m putting it here by the door . 
did you get a room ? 
do you have any luggage ,  mister  -  -   gladstone ? 
how are you ,  benjamin ? 
benjamin ,  i want to ask you something . 
you don &apos;t ? 
what do you drink ?  bourbon ? 
all right then . 
drink ? 
what do you think of me ? 
mrs .  robinson ,  you didn &apos;t  -  -  i mean you didn &apos;t expect  -  - 
mrs .  robinson ,  it makes me sick that i said that to you . 
no . 
then why do you keep running away ? 
but they would !  don &apos;t you see ? 
what ? 
benjamin  -  -  i want you to know i &apos;m available to you .  if you won &apos;t sleep with me this time  -  - 
may i sit down ? 
did you get us a room ? 
do you want me to get it ? 
do you want to get it now ? 
but there &apos;s one thing .  the desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious .  i mean  -  -  i don &apos;t know what their policy is  -  -  but  -  - 
well  -  -  goodbye then  -  - 
yes ? 
to tell you ? 
will you bring me a hanger ? 
wood or wire ?  they have both . 
benjamin ,  is this your first time ? 
you can admit that ,  can &apos;t you ? 
good .  i mean are we dead or something ? 
oh . 
what ? 
always ? 
please .  now tell me .  how do you know he won &apos;t wake up sometime and follow you . 
how many times a year . 
what ? 
why did you do that ? 
well i never thought of you and mr .  robinson as the kind of people who .  .  . 
i mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances ? 
well how did it happen ? 
i wish you &apos;d tell me . 
good . 
i have my reasons . 
i &apos;m not good enough for her to associate with ,  am i ?  i &apos;m not good enough to even talk about her ,  am i ? 
we &apos;re not dropping it .  now that &apos;s the reason ,  isn &apos;t it ?  i &apos;m a dirty degenerate ,  aren &apos;t i ?  i &apos;m not fit to  -  - 
no sir .  i am not proud that i spend my time with a broken - down alcoholic ! 
it &apos;s not !  i enjoy it !  i look forward to it .  it &apos;s the one thing i have to look forward to . 
now it seems to me  -  - 
braddock  -  -  braddock ? 
say hello to mrs .  robinson ,  benjamin . 
well why do you  -  -  why do you think that ? 
it &apos;s pretty embarrassing .  i really don &apos;t know what to tell mr .  robinson .  it &apos;s awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up elaine . 
sir ? 
you have yourself a few flings this summer .  i bet you &apos;re quite a ladies &apos; man . 
oh say  -  -  elaine gets down from berkeley on saturday . 
that &apos;s what i &apos;d do if i could .  nothing wrong with that .  hey ben ,  elaine &apos;s coming down from berkeley soon .  i want you to call her up this time . 
now look  -  -  please  -  - 
it shouldn &apos;t make any difference what happened . 
yes ? 
can you see me now ? 
i oughtn &apos;t to presume ,  but i  -  -   i &apos;m so grateful to you  -  -  it &apos;s been so marvelous .  the first time in my life i have gambled  -  -  i &apos;ve danced !  oh ,  you can laugh ,  gentlemen ,  but it &apos;s the first time in my life i &apos;ve ever tasted life ! 
i &apos;ll pay you back . 
never ? 
oh ! 
too bad . 
you were very different yesterday . 
why ? 
you live here ? 
oh ! 
so you feel like coming into a lady &apos;s room  -  -  and you come .  .  .  what now ? 
strange man .  .  . 
he disappeared .  later he was found dead . 
i want to be alone . 
i want to be alone  -  - 
the veronal  -  -  you .  i &apos;m going to stay here with you . 
and ? 
i &apos;ll give you what you need  -  -  i have money . 
hello  -  -  sorry i &apos;m late . 
what ? 
if i could get into a game i might win some . 
all right then . 
you &apos;re all right now  -  -  it &apos;s very late  -  -  goodnight ,  kringelein . 
the war . 
perhaps you could present me now ,  mr .  pimenov . 
oh ,  let the poor devil alone . 
so that &apos;s how we stand ,  baron . 
is that for me ? 
madam grusinskaya  -  -  at once  -  - 
telegrams ? 
oh  -  -  but  -  -  i  -  - 
you will stay ,  doctor  -  -  if you have nothing better to do ? 
oh ,  but doctor .  isn &apos;t this wonderful .  to live  -  -  to live  -  -  in the grand hotel . 
a masculine paradise  -  -  drink ,  the ladies ,  dancing .  .  . 
you may laugh .  caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you ,  but to me  -  -  they mean a great deal .  you see ,  i &apos;m ill and all of a sudden i got a fear of missing life .  i don &apos;t want to miss life  -  -  do you understand ? 
good evening ,  mr .  kringelein  -  -  where &apos;s the baron ? 
no  -  absinthe . 
a man might what ? 
he was in desperate straits .  he &apos;d been trying to raise money all day .  he laughed  -  -  poor devil !  and then a man like preysing kills him . 
then why did you have anything to do with him ? 
do you like me better ? 
tired ? 
i don &apos;t see why it &apos;s unusual for a stenographer to be pretty  -  -  if she does her work well ,   -  -  seems so silly .  i don &apos;t know why they don &apos;t like girls like me in offices .  personally ,  i hate offices  -  -  i &apos;d much rather be in the movies . 
moreover .  .  .  he was a lucky man  -  -  that man . 
cotton company  -  - 
how nice  -  -  your daughters ? 
is that mrs .  preysing . 
come and dance with me ,  mr .  kringelein . 
tomorrow morning . 
now ,  children ,  no fighting  -  -  save that for the office .  let &apos;s have our dance .  
yes . 
i must go to england  -  -  at once . 
i couldn &apos;t do that ,  you &apos;re a stranger to me . 
if the preysing people get the manchester contract ,  we shall certainly merge with the preysing company  -  -  but if they haven &apos;t they &apos;re ruined  -  -  preysing will have to declare himself . 
what ? 
oh  -  -  yes  -  -  i beg your pardon ! 
here &apos;s my signature  -  -  here preysing ,  sign here . 
nine - thirty ,  mr .  preysing keeps us waiting . 
madam has slept well ? 
yes ,  madam .  and now madam will sleep .  it is not long  &apos;till the train . 
good morning ,  pimenov . 
you may go ,  mr .  kringelein . 
my best friend  -  -  poor ,  baron  -  -  dead  -  -  just like that . 
yes ,  the police must be called . 
how much  -  -  how much do you want  -  -  you need money  -  -  you have nothing . 
the gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty - nine . 
what &apos;s the matter with you ? 
 &apos;deal with manchester definitely off !   &quot; preysing ,  oh  -  -  i &apos;d never have thought it of you . 
she had an engagement in the yellow room at five o &apos;clock  -  -  she was in a hurry . 
pretty as a picture . 
your what ? 
that &apos;s right .  take a little ,  leave a little . 
i certainly hope not . 
not much time . 
mrs .  dillon ,  your son was in some sort of accident .  he &apos;s had an internal hemorrhage ,  he &apos;s bleeding to death inside . 
his blood pressure is under a hundred .  i don &apos;t think he &apos;ll live to get to the hospital . 
take two ,  three days .  call when you get there . 
it was a gift .  it isn &apos;t worth anything at all ? 
i hope you &apos;re not too badly disappointed with us ,  mrs .  langtry . 
kaggs .  home office . 
when i said you being the best salesman here didn &apos;t say much ,  i meant for us .  i know your record with sarber and webb ,  and i &apos;d say you &apos;re a top - flight man ,  but you &apos;ve had no incentive .  no one walking on your heels .  just a lot of half asses ,  so the tendency &apos;s been not to stretch yourself .  i &apos;m bouncing the slobs ,  incidentally . 
well ,  uh .  .  .  no . 
oh ,  come on ,  roy . 
a well - rounded life .  i respect that .  but it has to have a center ,  roy ,  something you care about ,  something you can think about . 
not as tough as you ,  huh ? 
you don &apos;t put up with that !  nobody has to put up with that ! 
i just give you your life .  what you do with it is up to you . 
if you come out to the track ,  don &apos;t know me . 
her credit cards .  how far am i gonna get with that ? 
at what ? 
a job ?  i &apos;ve never had a legit job in my life ! 
and to survive ,  my way ,  i need money .  bobo knows about the stash in the car ,  so i didn &apos;t dare touch it ,  not if lilly dillon &apos;s dead .  so that leaves this . 
you don &apos;t know what i &apos;d do ,  roy .  you have no idea .  to live . 
i know what &apos;s bugging you ,  of course . 
you &apos;re getting off the grift ? 
if you stayed a crook ,  do you think you &apos;d live to be my ripe age ? 
well ,  uh .  .  . 
that money wouldn &apos;t last forever .  and then what ?  you &apos;d be back in some other part of the rackets .  another bobo justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands .  this way ,  you &apos;ve got to go the square route .  you could send me a card when you &apos;re settled ,  i could maybe help out sometimes .  .  . 
i &apos;ll have it tonight .  nine o &apos;clock ?  ten ? 
i can &apos;t .  i just left home . 
well ,  no ,  roy .  your mother found you . 
who else is paying for all this ?  you badmouth the woman all the time ,  but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you . 
and you never defend me .  you &apos;re afraid of her . 
no . 
nobody does that single - o . 
atascadero . 
i don &apos;t know ,  myra ,  i never had partners .  i never needed them . 
she didn &apos;t see you ,  in other words . 
you watch that mouth . 
not that it matters .   this is the morgue ? 
sure .  let &apos;s get it over . 
yes ,  i know ,  i know . 
ate the gun .  oh . 
mr .  simms . 
i &apos;ll be damned . 
funny ,  we just drove right in . 
bruce .  .  .  what &apos;s going on ?   the kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival . 
do you know who did this ? 
oh .   sorry .   i &apos;m on my way to the ring and  -  - 
alright ,  i was wrong .   there is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster . 
you &apos;re kidding with that answer ,  right ? 
any other psychotic relatives i should know about ?   jason ?   freddy krueger ? 
i &apos;m not leaving without her . 
what ?   where is she ? 
then i &apos;ll get caught . 
you okay ?   you seem a little off . 
it &apos;s john ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
i have to pee . 
fuckin &apos; a . 
ooooh ,  busted . 
you &apos;re so easy .  .  . 
is tim there ? 
whatever happened to women in back ? 
guess they  -  -  went to the fair after all . 
you &apos;ve been watching too much tv . 
no ,  mom  -  -  keep it on ! 
come on ,  mom .   we &apos;re gonna miss all the fun stuff ! 
this house is sacred to him .   it &apos;s the source of his memories  -  -  his rage .   mrs .  strode ,  i beg you .   don &apos;t let your family suffer the same fast as laurie and her daughter . 
god ,  what &apos;s wrong with him ? 
runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in northern europe thousands of years ago .   they were symbols  -  -  carved out of stone or pieces of wood .   of all the runes ,  thorn had the most negative influence .  cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic . 
danny !   danny ,  where are you ?  ! 
what now ?  ! 
it was jamie lloyd .   she came back ,  as i knew she would one day .   and whatever has brought her back has brought michael back as well . 
sometimes a cigar is just a cigar . 
you &apos;ve created a monster . 
home ,  sweet home . 
at least we found the diamonds . 
what &apos;ll you do for transportation ? 
i &apos;m liable to find anything ! 
i know ,  i know .   i dunno .   at least she &apos;s in the same house .   sure was spooky ,  looking in the window there ,  and there she was . 
fourteen times you told me .   i counted . 
alice would be absolutely tear - ass . 
i told you the uniform wouldn &apos;t help . 
all the more reason to go to africa . 
go live in a safe - deposit box -  - with your things .  looseleaf jesus -  - i wouldn &apos;t want to be married to him .   you know ? 
yeah .   i practically forgot .   but after you busted that thing ,  i got to thinking ,   &quot; jesus -  - maybe i &apos;ll start the violin again .  &quot;  that didn &apos;t just belong to woodly .   that belonged to everybody .   maybe he would have sold it to me ,  and i could have some fun .   after you busted the violin ,  boy ,  and penelope walked out ,  i thought to myself ,   &quot; jesus -  - who could blame her ?  &quot; 
i know you think that . 
if i hadn &apos;t done it .   if i &apos;d said to myself ,   &quot; screw it .   i &apos;m going to let all those people down there live .  &quot; 
yeah ,  jesus -  - but wars would be a lot better ,  i think ,  if guys would say to themselves sometimes ,   &quot; jesus -  - i &apos;m not going to do that to the enemy .   that &apos;s too much .  &quot;  you could have been the manufacturer of that violin there ,  even though you don &apos;t know how to make a violin ,  just by not busting it up .   i could have been the father of all those people in nagasaki ,  and the mother ,  too ,  just by not dropping the bomb .   i sent  &apos;em to heaven instead -  - and i don &apos;t think there is one . 
is penelope in ? 
i forgot my vacuum cleaner . 
eight years you guys were together -  -  through thick and thin . 
no matter what you say to me ,  i still think you &apos;re the greatest guy i ever knew . 
sir ? 
hello . 
ask it ! 
college ! 
what does he do -  - of an athletic nature ? 
oh hell . 
i saw your father fight major siegfried von konigswald ,  the beast of yugoslavia ,  hand to hand . 
mhravitch .   remember that name . 
he seems to think they are .   he told me that were . 
why don &apos;t you go to bed -  - son . 
she was on her way home from a meeting of the african violet society ,  and they got her . 
a hundred dollars ! 
can i get dressed first ? 
no . 
gee whiz ,  dad -  - 
yes ,  sir .   it was a very unusual automobile .  it was a cadillac ,  but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be .   and what to drink ? 
not at all . 
like hugging a lamp post . 
when i &apos;m dead -  -   or fucking . 
you know what i want ?   i want you both to be friends .   i know you both ,  respect you both .  you should be friends . 
harold ! 
you &apos;ll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again .   you used to eat it up . 
breakfast ? 
chow ,  chow ,  chow !   god damn it -  -  nutriment ! 
and no one &apos;s there now ? 
i came for paul as well . 
a dozen ? 
did you like it ,  dear ? 
he had hoped that someone would be playing it still -  - two hundred years from now . 
see how you &apos;ve upset him .   he was so merry and hale before you came home . 
what kind of a country has this become ?   the men wear beads and refuse to fight -  - and the woman adore them .   america &apos;s days of greatness are over .   it has drunk the blue soup . 
an indian narcotic we were forced to drink .   it put us in a haze -  - a honey - colored haze which was lavender around the edge .   we laughed ,  we sang ,  we snoozed .   when a bird called ,  we answered back .  every living thing was our brother or our sister ,  we thought .  looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long ,  and we cried .   we had a funeral that went on for five days -  - for the cockroach !   i sang  &quot; oh promise me .  &quot;  can you imagine ?  where the hell did i ever learn the words to  &quot; oh promise me &quot;  ?   looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a b - 36 .   all the time we were drinking more blue soup ,  more blue soup !   never stopped drinking blue soup .   blue soup all the time .  we &apos;d go out after food in that honey - colored haze ,  and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender . 
help your mother find the bullet . 
how do i load ? 
norbert -  - you come ,  too .   let him go ,  harold .   let him go . 
but here you are inside ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
will you please go ?   an emergency ! 
how was the emergency ,  doctor ?  profitable ,  i hope . 
tough luck .   you &apos;ll have to split the fee . 
i feel the same way .   what next ? 
i thought she was a widow . 
there &apos;s a certain amount of information there . 
what brought you back ? 
don quixote . 
something seems to have happened to my self - respect . 
the new hero is you . 
my self - respect is gone -  - and my soldier &apos;s honor with it .   it is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man . 
can i beg for mercy -  - on my knees ? 
don &apos;t shoot . 
no .   no . 
new lives begin ! 
she married an accountant named stanley kestenbaum . 
who &apos;s dead ? 
what happened ? 
because he was cruel ? 
that goes double for me . 
i feel like i want to yell my head off -  - just yell anything .   bulllllllllllllll - dickey ! 
no . 
a what kind of doctor ? 
that &apos;s an interesting piece of news . 
in a railroad accident many years ago . 
norbert was just beginning practice .  a real man would have sold her to a catfood company ,  i suppose .   as far as that goes ,  j .  edgar hoover still lives with his mother . 
are you and dr .  woodly engaged ? 
then who flushed the toilet ? 
what are his symptoms ? 
everything stays as it is ! 
don &apos;t worry about it . 
it came yesterday .   i haven &apos;t opened it yet . 
he &apos;d kill me .   he &apos;d be right to kill me ,  too -  - the kind of guy he is . 
if you want to wrestle ,  you got lehigh .   if you want to play tennis ,  you go to vanderbilt . 
i &apos;m touched . 
gentlemen !   is this right for a fight ?   it &apos;s been so long . 
possibly . 
i &apos;m sorry . 
thank you ,  herb .   you &apos;re a wonderful man .   you really are .  everybody respects you for what you &apos;ve done for scouting and the little league . 
you were wonderful . 
you and harold are friends ? 
i am dr .  norbert woodly -  - a physician ,  a healer .   i find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society .   gentleness must replace violence everywhere ,  or we are doomed . 
herb shuttle is taking me to a fight . 
the animals made her sneeze and cry too much . 
they made her so sleepy she couldn &apos;t work . 
i never knew when to hold it -  - or who to ask ,  or what to say . 
if you warned him against it as much as you say ,  it &apos;s almost a certainty . 
they didn &apos;t murder me . 
no .   but he &apos;s going to be .   if he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side ,  i can say to him ,   &quot; you and i are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight .  &quot;   on that we can build . 
it &apos;s the planet that &apos;s in ghastly trouble now and all our brothers and sisters thereon . 
chinese maniacs and russian maniacs and american maniacs and french maniacs and british maniacs have turned this lovely ,  moist ,  nourishing blue - green ball into a doomsday device .   let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile ,  and that &apos;s the end of mankind . 
you ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day ? 
kid -  - kid -  - 
we have this new club up here in heaven . 
we only have two members so far ,  but it &apos;s growing all the time . 
walt disney ,  who gave us snow white and the seven dwarfs ,  plays shuffleboard .   jesus christ plays shuffleboard . 
you &apos;re not exactly the type we &apos;re looking for . 
no ,  just not the type . 
the boy your daughter was talking to didn &apos;t work at the park .  we &apos;ve interviewed everybody there . 
there &apos;s no evidence of any foul play at present .  i hope she &apos;s just a runaway . 
well ,  actually i wanted to ask about this girl .  i have her picture here . 
 .  .  . the disciplines :  bondage ,  domination and humiliation . 
are you still going with that fella that teaches at grand valley ? 
are you niki ? 
where is she ? 
i didn &apos;t think so .  i &apos;ve fucked detectives .  who are you ? 
don &apos;t knock it .  a girl can save up a lot money doing this  -  -  big money .  then you &apos;re free .  you can go off to europe ,  meet somebody ,  get married .  my girlfriend &apos;s going to buy her own beauty parlor .  not me .  i &apos;m gonna travel .   &apos;keep movin &apos; that &apos;s my motto .   would you rather work at copper penny at a dollar - eighty an hour ,  having every two - bit cocksucker able to yell at you ?  i can make more money suc .  .  .  doing what i do for five minutes than i can all week at another job . 
what &apos;s t - j ? 
they were here ? 
be that as it may .  u is for unconditional election .  god has chosen a certain number of people to be saved ,  the elect ,  and he has chosen them from the beginning of time .  l is for limited atonement .  only a limited number will be atoned ,  will go to heaven . 
it &apos;s not quite the same thing . 
i must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life .  at least it feels that way . 
grand rapids ?  of course . 
i wouldn &apos;t expect too much .  i mean about her coming back .  once a girl gets into the life . 
i don &apos;t blame you ,  niki .  really i don &apos;t .  it &apos;s this culture ,  where everything &apos;s based on sex ,  sold on sex .  .  .    .  .  . magazines ,  music ,  tv .  it &apos;s destroying everything .  buy this  &apos;cause of sex ,  use this  &apos;cause of sex .  kids think it &apos;s normal .  they think they &apos;re supposed to talk dirty ,  wear scanty clothes .  .  . 
listen ,  niki .  my daughter &apos;s been missing five months .  i &apos;ve gone through a lot to find out what &apos;s happened to her .  i just saw a girl killed .  i will not let tod slip out of my hands .  you have to tell me where he is . 
dogshit .  worse yet ,  they don &apos;t care . 
no ,  i didn &apos;t think she was .  let me get the picture here .  let me guess .  she was an absolutely clean girl ,  a model daughter ,  she never had rebellious or impure thoughts ,  she didn &apos;t fuck around .  .  . 
as i was saying ,  i &apos;ll pick up the thread .  there &apos;s a number of ways i can go .  there &apos;s not much you can do here .  stay if you want .  maybe it &apos;d be better if you went back home .  go through kristen &apos;s personal stuff .  ask around ,  maybe she knew somebody out here .   look ,  i do this a lot .  i work at a minimum rate of $750 . 00 a week .  it may seem like a lot of money to you ,  but it ain &apos;t .  you could hire cheaper . 
in g . r .  ?  why ? 
i &apos;ve got a meeting .  .  . 
it was called  &apos;slave of love &apos; when i bought it .  next time it &apos;s sold ,  it &apos;ll be called something else . 
do the police want to arrest me ? 
yeah ,  sure . 
is marsha there ? 
jake ? 
oh yeah ?  i remember that .  it was made by some college kids . 
hey ,  stop ,  stop .  i &apos;ll do anything you want .  it &apos;s okay .  i can dig it .  you can do anything you want to me . 
i hear you got money to spend .   i hear you &apos;re interested in .  .  .  interesting things . 
do you work for the san francisco police department ,  or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency ? 
you &apos;re talking about real excitement ? 
meet me here today at seven o &apos;clock .  with the money .  then we &apos;ll go see the film . 
fifty cents admission . 
but i .  .  . 
no .  i walked up .  don &apos;t ride elevators . 
well ,  bill  -  -  mind if i call you bill ?   let me be frank .  i &apos;ve made a lot of money .  i &apos;ve got my own business in detroit .  rivets .  i make rivets and sell them to fisher body .   well ,  rivets ,  you know ,  can get pretty boring after a while .  when my business manager told me i should shelter some money ,  i thought i &apos;d try this . 
i thought you were a businessman . 
sounds all right . 
i don &apos;t suppose you &apos;ve ever seen this girl before either ?  her name &apos;s kristen ,  but i suppose you &apos;ve never seen her ? 
you going to knott &apos;s berry farm with him ? 
what does that do ? 
i &apos;m off that case .  he fired me . 
to his own daughter ? 
he seems very nice .  is harold interested in ,  eh ,  what &apos;s going on ?  i think it &apos;s such a super thing to study .  and then ,  of course ,  i can always fall back on home ec . 
lady ,  let me get this straight . 
oh ,  well .  must have been your brother . 
check . 
oh .  it looks like a hearse .   very nice .  compact . 
edith was just telling me about her job . 
what do you see ? 
eh ,  no .  thank you . 
i don &apos;t know . 
can i drop you anywhere ,  harold ? 
yes . 
of course ,  i &apos;ve had to make some additions for the new models ,  but not as many as you might think .  once you have your basic set it &apos;s then only a question of variation . 
sort of . 
all right . 
how about some ginger pie ? 
do you often model for glaucus ? 
what ? 
he &apos;s never finished one yet .  he has around him every kind of hand tool known to man ,  but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake . 
a little after - dinner liqueur ,  harold ? 
i think he &apos;s following us . 
don &apos;t you think we should turn off the heat ? 
i like glaucus . 
maude ,  i must speak to you . 
but they &apos;ll put me in jail . 
just like this . 
that wasn &apos;t very scary . 
 -  end where i began . 
why are there no photographs in these frames ? 
why ? 
supper for two . 
mother . 
i &apos;m getting married . 
i put a lot of effort into these things . 
and a lot of time . 
no . 
my mother spoke to my uncle victor .  he &apos;s in the army and he fixed it up . 
is it the machines ?  the noise ?  the people ? 
harold ? 
i see .   were you happy at school ,  harold ? 
your classmates ? 
then why did you leave ? 
what would you say ? 
and so i ask you  -  why the hell did we give up on the germans ?  those damn politicians in washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace .  hell ,  look at history .  the two best wars this country has fought were against the jerries .  now i say ,  get the krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong ,  and let &apos;s get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support . 
the moment of truth . 
i &apos;d like that .  you could see the blood squirt out . 
sir ,  how about souvenirs ? 
harold ,  calm down !  this is .  .  . 
good afternoon ,  officer .  bit of trouble here ? 
well ,  it &apos;s a tricky turn . 
tell me  -  -    -  -  is that car parked all right ? 
well ,  i didn &apos;t . 
oh ,  kirsty; so eager to play ,  so reluctant to admit it . 
he .  .  .  he loved me . 
well ,  the sofa isn &apos;t often used for sleeping on .  .  . 
don &apos;t worry about it .  your attitude sucks anyway . 
you didn &apos;t tell me .  do you mean malahide &apos;s got .  .  . 
nonsense ,  i .  .  . 
where am i ? 
steve .  .  . 
they were over here ,  professor . 
harbinger of pestilence ,  seed of destruction  -  - 
you are a catholic ?  ? 
half transmission .  nonsense  -  -  german ghost stories ! 
do you believe in hell ? 
c &apos;mon  -  -  rasputin ?  ? 
it &apos;s her choice  -  -   she &apos;s human  -  - 
where am i  -  -  exactly ,  sir ? 
i &apos;m in way over my head ,  i know that much . 
oh ,  jesus !  !  hellboy  -  -   ?  ?  is real  -  - 
she &apos;s dead . 
but not everyone was so lucky .   two agents died today .  clay probably won &apos;t survive the night .  you &apos;re reckless . 
what are you trying to say ? 
 -  -  should go back .  now ! 
whatcha looking at ,  john ?  ? 
helping you  -  -  i just  -  - 
myers ?  ?  ?  how &apos;s your arm ? 
i just fried stinky .  tell father i &apos;ll be home .  he shouldn &apos;t wait up . 
no ,  no ,  no ,  it &apos;s fine :  i do my job ,  i take a break . 
myers ? 
where do you  -  - 
hey ,  your chili &apos;s getting cold  -  - 
are you sure about this ? 
hi . 
listen .  i &apos;m not like myers .  he makes you feel like you belong .  and  -  -  that &apos;s good .  it really is .  i  -  -  wish i could do something about this  -  -   but i can &apos;t .   i can promise you only two things .  .  .  one :  i &apos;ll always look this good .  two :  i won &apos;t give up on you .  ever . 
that you feel that way about me . 
that your daughter ? 
got her mother &apos;s looks . 
oh . 
the box .  .  .  you opened it .  we came . 
it &apos;s a means to summon us  -  -  it &apos;s called the lament configuration . 
suppose he had slipped us .  what significance has that ? 
you remember . 
there is going to be a wedding ? 
but you said  -  - 
help me . 
back from where ? 
my nerves .  .  .  are beginning to work again . 
 -  -  to heal me completely .  then we can be away from here ,  before they come looking . 
it &apos;s not any box .  it &apos;s called the lament configuration .  it &apos;s a puzzle . 
to experience beyond anything ever known .  at least that &apos;s what i was promised when i bought it .  pleasure from heaven or hell .  i didn &apos;t much care which . 
sure .  somewhere safe .   safe .  christ !  they tortured me here .  in this room . 
the cenobites .  the creatures the box set free .   sometimes i think they &apos;re still here .  just behind the walls .  them and their hooks and their beasts .  just waiting to break out again .  except that i &apos;ve got the box . 
that &apos;s probably her now .  or the police . 
kirsty . 
what &apos;s the problem ? 
you &apos;re not going to faint . 
take it slowly . 
julia ? 
i &apos;ll be o . k .  just leave me be a while . 
are you all right ? 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
you know it &apos;s not often i .  .  .  you know .  .  . 
well i want you to see the house . 
it &apos;s not a gesture .  i want to do this on my own .  come on ,  trust me a little will you ? 
big house . 
i have to talk to you . 
i won &apos;t be able to stand . 
you &apos;re not going ? 
meaning what ? 
these things .  .  .  they want to take me  -  - 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
alison &apos;s . 
don &apos;t you want to hear what &apos;s next ? 
yeah . 
what ? 
what are you snickering about ? 
there &apos;s something different about the sound of her voice .  .  .  and what did she mean last night ,  she hasn &apos;t slept with him yet .   yet .   what does  &quot; yet &quot;  mean ,  anyway ?    &quot; i haven &apos;t seen .  .  .  evil dead ii yet .  &quot;  what does that mean ?   it means you &apos;re going to go ,  doesn &apos;t it ? 
i &apos;m sorry ,  rob ,  but i &apos;m struggling here .   i don &apos;t understand any part of this conversation .   you &apos;re asking me what i would think if you told me that you hadn &apos;t seen a film that you &apos;ve seen .   what am i supposed to say ? 
my band . 
thanks for your support ,  rob .   really appreciate it . 
i didn &apos;t make up the name .   it &apos;s the steely dan song .   and it was in the commitments . 
what &apos;s up ? 
fuck off ,  barry . 
liar .   we saw it in the lawrence kasdan double - bill with body heat . 
what is she doing ?   okay ,  20% . 
you couldn &apos;t be .   look ,  barry .  there &apos;s going to be people from laura &apos;s work there ,  people who own dogs and babies and tina turner albums .   how are you going to cope with them ? 
great .   can i have it then ? 
it &apos;s almost impossible to find ,  especially on cd .   yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables .   but every other echo and the bunnymen album  -  - 
hey ,  barry . 
nevermind .   any five .   so four more . 
well it was a friend &apos;s idea ,  really ,  and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it .   so .  .  .   i should really put a james brown in there  -  - 
yeah . 
who ?   oh .   my friend .   my friend is laura .   a girl .   a friend who &apos;s a girl . 
no ,  that &apos;s okay .   really . 
hey .   didn &apos;t you steal that one already ? 
let &apos;s not . 
i will now sell four copies of cats and dogs by the royal trux . 
well we rang $900 today . 
i &apos;m upset ,  but i &apos;m fine . 
what needs sorting out ? 
jeez .   he goes on long enough . 
 -  -  made .   made .   marvin gaye is dead ,  his father shot him in  -  - 
you used to care more about things like marvin gaye than you do now .  when i first met you ,  and i made you that tape ,  you loved it .   you said  -  -  and i quote  -  -   &quot; it was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection .  &quot; 
yes .   look at me .   look at our  -  -  the apartment .   what else do i have ,  other than records and cds ? 
have you tackled the great reorganization yet ? 
i guess it &apos;s not that obvious ,  then . 
did you say something ? 
rob .   don &apos;t be childish . 
you won &apos;t like it . 
hi . 
fine ,  i &apos;m sure it &apos;s in the file at home .   i &apos;ll call you when i find it ,  and then we &apos;ll talk . 
i figured it was .   where are you ? 
i don &apos;t want to .   don &apos;t need to .   i love you . 
i got it .   you like sting but you don &apos;t like gram parsons ,  because you &apos;ve never heard of him . 
do you want me to be there ? 
i &apos;ve only got a couple left .   i &apos;m saving them for later . 
oh ,  c &apos;mon ,  laura .   just say something .  lie ,  if you want .   it &apos;d stop me asking you questions and it &apos;d make me feel better . 
i can &apos;t go to work with my hair dyed pink .   and i can afford to go shopping more now ,  and i &apos;ve met a couple people i like over the last year or so . 
what do you ever do that can &apos;t be cancelled ? 
barry said its done . 
i &apos;m sorry .   but two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for the reader ,  weren &apos;t you ? 
no .   probably not . 
about what ? 
i &apos;m an idiot .   i should have played the record first .   this place is about to get burned down . 
rob here . 
what &apos;s happenin &apos; . 
i know i can &apos;t speak now because laura &apos;s father died ,  and i just have to take it because otherwise i &apos;m a bad guy ,  with the emphasis on guy ,  self - centered .   well ,  i &apos;m fucking not ,  not all the time ,  anyway ,  i &apos;m really sorry jo .   but you know ,  liz .  .  .  i can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself .   and maybe you think i should ,  but it &apos;s not much of a life ,  you know ? 
books ,  records ,  films  -  -  these things matter .   call me shallow but it &apos;s the damn truth ,  and by this measure i was having one of the best dates of my life . 
the conformist . 
are you okay ? 
look .   can i pay you properly ?   you don &apos;t have to tell him what you got .  send him forty - five bucks and blow the rest .   give it to charity .   or something . 
eleven - hundred .   that &apos;s my lowest offer . 
uh ,  yes i ,  like ,  do .  .  .  it &apos;s simple .  you make the tracks  -  -  recording studio  -  -  deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut ,  the master is then dubbed to submasters ,  which are the  &quot; mothers ,  &quot;  as their called ,  for each press in the plant .  you press the cd &apos;s or records ,  put in your cover art ,  and that &apos;s it . 
we saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin &apos; for a renaissance fair . 
probably just some exec ducking an ex - wife . 
how old is richard ? 
how &apos;s your uncle ?   i hardly ever see him anymore . 
figured you knew more about swords than i did . 
you &apos;re the expert . 
this is against the rules . 
i have friends . 
he tried to kill me last night . 
i left a man dead in felton .   but you don &apos;t really care ,  do you ? 
he was innocent . 
no . 
i &apos;m a historian ,  mr .  taupin .  only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face . 
he sees me as a threat . 
is this what you killed them with ? 
our cars were seen together in felton .   they &apos;re calling me an accessory to murder . 
when you finish ,  what then ? 
you make it all sound so simple . 
you want me to front for you . 
there was a man once .   just a simple woodcarver .   but he understood .   more than anyone he could see to the heart of it .   it never ends .   today is the same as the first .   tomorrow will be the same as today .   so much time .   and all of it wasted .   you love history ? 
the estate stuff is pretty straight forward .   just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat . 
no .   so what now ?   we just wait ? 
maybe it would do us both good . 
and you are william taupin ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
i &apos;m not even sure why . 
yes . 
aren &apos;t you getting a little old for this ?   you flunked out of law school . 
i &apos;m calling an attorney . 
what are you going to tell them ?   that you &apos;re protecting a man who &apos;s killed four people ? 
but we might just give it the  &apos;ole college try .   what with the court back ups ,  it could be days before you got an arraignment .  but then ,  i &apos;m sure the flunk - out neice of the d . a .  knows all about that . 
i have witnesses that can put the two of you together . 
corey ,  you _owe_ me . 
your back ,  it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle ? 
hmm ,  que rico .   what is it you call this ? 
listen to me .   hear the words . 
three days you &apos;ve laid there .  it &apos;s time you ate . 
aye . 
it will take less effort as you learn . 
what is the fascinatioon ?   it is only a leaf . 
as they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes .   to feel it ,  to know it ,  is to be in touch with the will of every living thing . 
you have not been fully trained .  but you will learn .   and you will be good ,  i can feel that .   you have apt -  itude .   this is why our friend is so concerned . 
you must be .   you have responsibilities .  you must learn the rules .   you can never attract attention to yourself ,  never show the side that will draw others to you .   you will always know when you are in the presence of another .   beware .  but more importantly conor macleod ,  will be your battle against time .   in the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat .   people will become a transitory ,  pathetic lot .   the only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent .   but life without morality ,  without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love ,  is no life at all .   that is how the others exist .   nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last .   keep your soul sewed to the earth .   do not become one of them . 
not so scared . 
finish your prayers ? 
complete your inspection ? 
equals ? 
here .   the hook should go just below the head ,  where the meat is toughest . 
i want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff . 
yeah . 
the last four . 
and have you something to settle with me ? 
no ,  seriously .   we used to shoot pool together in rangoon . 
tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have .   all else is just marking time .   you &apos;re marking time . 
run ! 
you disappoint me .   i thought you &apos;d finally gotten over that sort of thing . 
what &apos;s the point !   you have me ,  finish it ! 
do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh -  borhood at night ? 
look ,  i don &apos;t know what the hell you &apos;re up to ,  but i think i &apos;ve got a pretty good idea . 
sure take after him .   never seen a father and son look more alike . 
the resemblance is amazing . 
how do you mean ? 
i suppose you &apos;re right  -  -  but if it gets rough ,  remember i &apos;m here . 
oh ,  it isn &apos;t like that . 
but  -  - 
i can &apos;t imagine who did it .  i can &apos;t think of any enemies i have . 
bruce !  !  how &apos;d you get out ? 
hildy !  where &apos;s mother ? 
you &apos;re bruce baldwin ? 
oh ,  i thought there was something funny .  .  .  you see ,  bruce ,  you don &apos;t mind if i call you bruce ,  do you ?  after all ,  we &apos;re practically related  -  - 
attaboy !   come on ,  bruce . 
i know i wasn &apos;t a good husband ,  hildy ,  but you can always count on me . 
i sometimes wish i &apos;d taken out insurance  -  -  but ,  of course ,  now it doesn &apos;t matter .  still ,  i suppose it would have been the smart thing to do . 
are you sure williams is not all there ? 
how long would the interview take ? 
well ,  bruce ,  here you are  -  -  certified and everything . 
don &apos;t want to forget this ,  you know .  might start to rain again . 
well ,  anyway ,  i know hildy &apos;s getting a good man . 
don &apos;t thank me .  i should thank you .  so long . 
hildy ! 
i &apos;ll see she &apos;s there ,  bruce ,  i promise you . 
i know how you feel ,  bruce ,  but you &apos;ve got to forgive her .  she &apos;s only a woman ,  after all . 
ts !  ts !  ts ! 
does it ?  you forget the power that always watches over the morning post . 
that &apos;s absurd on the face of it ,  mr .  burns !  he &apos;s talking like a child . 
save that for the tribune . 
how long is what ? 
no  -  -  mama doesn &apos;t dream about you any more ,  walter .  you wouldn &apos;t know the old girl now . 
a fellow your age ,  hiring an airplane to write :    &apos;hildy :  don &apos;t be hasty  -  -  remember my dimple .  walter .  !  it held things up twenty minutes while the judge ran out to watch it . 
i haven &apos;t any hard feelings . 
you can break it ,  can &apos;t you ? 
sure you can .  come on . 
what were you when you came here five years ago ?  a little college girl from a school of journalism !  i took a little doll - faced mugg  -  - 
it would have worked if you &apos;d been satisfied with just being editor and reporter .  but no !  you had to marry me and spoil everything . 
great grief !  what &apos;s that other paper going to give you ? 
oh !  in that case ,  the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it .  trying to blackjack  -  - 
bermuda . 
not what you &apos;d call rich .  makes about five thousand a year . 
he &apos;s in the insurance business . 
i don &apos;t know about water buffaloes ,  but i know about him .  he &apos;s kind and sweet and considerate .  he wants a home  -  -  and children . 
well ,  he &apos;s waiting in the anteroom for me now . 
allow me . 
now you &apos;re talking ! 
exclusive ?  that &apos;s great . 
no ,  this is on the level ,  walter .  i &apos;m not good enough to make this one up .  the sheriff gave his gun to the professor ,  the professor gave it to earl ,  and earl gave it right back to the professor  -  -  right in the stomach !  who ?  no ,  egelhoffer wasn &apos;t hurt badly .  they took him to the county hospital where they &apos;re afraid he &apos;ll recover . 
where do you think you &apos;re going ? 
you &apos;ve kicked over the whole city hall like an apple - cart .  you &apos;ve got the mayor and hartman backed against a wall .  you &apos;ve put one administration out and another in .  this isn &apos;t a newspaper story  -  -  it &apos;s a career !  and you stand there belly - aching about whether you catch an eight o &apos;clock train or a nine o &apos;clock train !  still a doll - faced mugg !  that &apos;s all you are . 
we &apos;re going to take him over to my private office .   where &apos;s our phone ? 
get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load ,  will you ?  snap into it ! 
well ,  keep going !  we want an extra out on the streets before it &apos;s too late ! 
what happened ? 
who ?   hello ,  butch !  where are you ? 
what are you doing there ?  haven &apos;t you even started ? 
i can &apos;t hear .  .  .  you got who ?  speak up !  a what ?  .  .  .  you can &apos;t stop for a dame now ! 
don &apos;t open that ! 
we sure did ,  but we had to go in hiding for a week . 
sorry ,  hildy .  i didn &apos;t mean to be making love to another man &apos;s fiancee . 
well ,  if she looked like you  -  -  say !  my brains and your looks  -  -  that mightn &apos;t be such a bad combination . 
what &apos;s the good of arguing about something that probably doesn &apos;t exist ?  look ,  hildy ,  i &apos;m proposing to you .  what do you say ? 
that &apos;s what he said the last time .  don &apos;t believe him ,  judge . 
come on ,  sheriff .  we &apos;ve got to get bail . 
oh ,  dear !  oh ,  dear ! 
anything you want ,  boss . 
you know me .  the shirt off my back . 
and that means earl williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us ! 
we &apos;ll have to satisfy them .  what would you say to giving them a joint interview ?  i could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects . 
hey ! 
yeah ?  what did he ever do for his country ? 
trouble is ,  when the red menace shows up the sheriff will still be crying  &apos;wolf !  &apos;
she says she &apos;s gonna write fiction . 
you guys wanna play some more poker ?

goodbye ,  yonson . 
that &apos;s murder ! 
for who ? 
well ,  wait a minute ,  will you ?  i &apos;m in conference . 
i mean i &apos;m scratching your name off the ticket tuesday and running czernecki in your place .  it &apos;s nothing personal .  and ,  pete  -  -  it &apos;s the only way out .  it &apos;s a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make . 
that gives you an idea of what i &apos;m up against ! 
i know it !  but they &apos;ve got nothing to do with this case !  do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang earl williams we &apos;re going to lose  &apos;em ? 
dementia praecox oh - h - h ! 
tell  &apos;em the party is through in this state on account of you . 
no  -  -  don &apos;t out me off . 
that &apos;s a lie !  ! 
fine ,  thanks ,  sheriff . 
i won &apos;t . 
i &apos;m telling you .  can you imagine bumping into a load of cops ?  !  they come rollin &apos; out like oranges ! 
nobody &apos;s going to rush me into anything !   you keep away from me !  
i don &apos;t know why you boys are so good to me . 
did you get that ,  hildy ? 
if walter burns calls ,  hold the wire for me ,  will you ?  i &apos;ll be right back .  
look out ,  you  -  - 
so long ,  nothing !  where &apos;s bruce baldwin &apos;s wallet ? 
kings and sixes . 
any dope yet on how he got out ? 
hiding him where ? 
i don &apos;t know what she &apos;s talking about .  i never said any such thing . 
they &apos;re very simple .  i believe in the golden rule .  i &apos;m not the first man to die for preaching it .  but if they would only listen to it  -  -  we could have a fine ,  decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things . 
they &apos;re newspaper men ,  mollie .  they can &apos;t help themselves .  the lord made them that way . 
they got him surrounded some place  -  -  gonna shoot him like a dog ! 
the city sealer &apos;s office ! 
why not ? 
but you could bring  &apos;em in here !  we &apos;ll pay all your expenses . 
no ,  they wouldn &apos;t  -  -  they &apos;d gain one !  and i guarantee that they &apos;ll graduate with highest honors ! 
they wouldn &apos;t take it . 
want to know why they &apos;re called faith ,  hope ,  grace and charity ? 
grandpa ,  if you think of something hard enough ,  can you make it happen ? 
go and ask her if she wants to play . 
please god .  not on us .  drop it on mrs .  evans .  she &apos;s a cow . 
you did that for me ,  and on the last day of your holidays ? 
wow ! 
who pays for them ? 
boy ,  that was some air - raid . 
you &apos;re a mug ,  clive .  we did our bit in the last lot . 
what kind of war is this mac ?   up there in cumberland ,  we never see an air - raid .  the worst problem i have is getting a new typewriter ribbon .  when i rode in against the turks ,  i knew what it was about . 
there was talk of planting some when we first came . 
except the servicemen . 
has sue got it right ? 
taste it .  why don &apos;t you taste it ? 
i &apos;m glad you didn &apos;t send them to your aunt . 
he always knows . 
i won &apos;t have this vulgar talk in my house . 
what is it ,  pet ? 
i can &apos;t do it .  what &apos;s the point ? 
you &apos;re having me on ,  molly . 
i &apos;m so glad you could come .  here we are ,  all together again . 
whoa ,  thanks for stopping .  i been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years .

so ,  you live here alone .  .  .  i mean with just your brother ? 
why ?  you gonna do something about it ? 
you all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people . 
really ?  huh ,  i thought for sure you &apos;d say lynette fromme .  she &apos;s got that snooty vibe i know you dig . 
fuck yeah ,  she is .  i &apos;d join a cult to get some of that .  .  .  and the best part is she didn &apos;t try to kill the president or nothing ,  so that baggage ain &apos;t hanging around . 
oh yeah ,  i remember now . 
perfect . 
i &apos;m not exactly sure .  .  .  it looks close .  did we pass an abandoned school bus yet ? 
tire &apos;s fucking gone crap on us ,  man .  there &apos;s no saving it now . 
hey ,  i asked you if you wanted some chicken . 
almost there . 
just grin and bear it . 
don &apos;t look back ,  just get in the car . 
well ,  i got some bad news and some bad news . 
this is starting to make me real uncomfortable . 
how much is a person supposed to stand ? 
what &apos;d you see ,  who was she with ,  where were they going ? 
and .  .  . 
worse than a fucking rabid baboon . 
i always loved that mute broad that chuck heston was shacking up with . 
yeah ,  now there &apos;s the perfect woman . 
tiny ain &apos;t got no car ,  he ain &apos;t even got a bicycle . 
ugh ,  what &apos;s that smell ? 
you know what jerry ,  who really cares at this point ? 
thank you . 
really ,  now is not the time to make waves . 
what are you laughing at ? 
you gotta be kidding me .  this chick is wasted . 
that was good babe ,  just keep doing that . 
well ,  don &apos;t take too long ,  the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix .  .  .  i know ,  i know i forgot to mention that halloween falls on a school night ,  so they &apos;re trick or treating tonight .  .  .  i got the joint decked out this year ,  built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid . 
rise and shine . 
i know ,  that was some crazy shit .  i never in a million years would have believed it if i hadn &apos;t seen it . 
don &apos;t even say it . 
holy jesus ,  somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing . 
shit ,  i wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on  &apos;em . 
open up the trunk . 
so ,  what brings you kids way out here ,  ain &apos;t you got something better to do for halloween than wander around out here in the sticks ? 
great .  i thought i felt a certain attraction between mary and tiny soon as he walked in . 
this is way too fucked up for words . 
behold .  .  .  the fish - boy ! 
fuck you ,  you fucking freak ! 
think .  .  .  do any of these kids look familiar in any way ? 
grampa .  .  .  watch the language . 
i &apos;m the one who brings the devil &apos;s brandy .  .  .  
that &apos;s true ,  otis .  .  .  not that we &apos;re having a bad time ,  but .  .  . 
hey . 
we gotta break it open . 
fuck ,  go to the car .  .  .  call for backup .  tell  &apos;em officer down . 
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s a logical explanation . 
sounds like a bad idea to me ,  probally just get in the way . 
i guess not . 
over . 
tell him ,  harold . 
look ,  if you &apos;re going to be like that .  .  .  you should be appreciative that i &apos;m interested . 
good morning .  .  .   we need a name for him ,  don &apos;t we ? 
you decide .  today is your day . 
oh ,  hi ,  gabrielle . 
no .  don &apos;t be .  i really enjoy hearing that .  you &apos;re a terrific assistant . 
shall we close up ,  then ? 
isn &apos;t puff doing spectacularly ,  honey ? 
my little french . 
like what ? 
anyway .  come already to the point . 
i &apos;ve been seeing johannsen in chemistry . 
so we &apos;ve got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements ,  my wonderful men . 
i know .  and that &apos;s great .  but it would be great in a better way ,  not a better way but a different way ,  if i could find him and bring him back . 
it shan &apos;t happen again .  i swear it .  i &apos;m just getting my sea legs ,  you know . 
no .  this is the end of the road .  there &apos;s a dead human being here .  for all of his faults ,  he was a human being ,  and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody . 
your brother should have his license revoked . 
i &apos;m going to miss you . 
i like you so much ,  with or without hair .   but don &apos;t spread that around .  bad for business . 
it looks wonderful . 
boy ,  this is good ! 
actually ,  mother and father ,  you look very ,  very old .  you look terrible . 
i was simply attempting to keep the evening light .  you know that i feel similarly to you about nature . 
darling ,  did you bring the insect repellent lotion ? 
oh ,  and the sun block ? 
what spf ,  sweetie ? 
i think i &apos;ll get johannsen in chemistry on that .   oh !  did you bring the first aid kit ? 
i think we should go .  please .  before he wakes up and ,  i don &apos;t know ,  eats us ,  or whatever feral things do . 
feral ,  huh ?  totally uncontaminated ? 
don &apos;t you see ?  he &apos;s my tabula rasa ,  my eliza dolittle .  he &apos;s my ticket to the top of the behaviorist food chain .  he &apos;s going to make me famous . 
 .  .  . what is it that makes us human ,  if not the knowledge that we are indeed human ?  think of this poor soul &apos;s education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon .  .  . 
who is it ? 
because ,  you know ,  you seem so distant .  and you work late every night .  and we hardly ever have sex ,  and when we do ,  it &apos;s .  .  .  i don &apos;t know .  it feels different . 
oh !   i didn &apos;t see you there ,  sneaky boy !   you &apos;re like a boy sneaking in .  .  . 
oh ,  baby .  i &apos;m sorry .  can &apos;t you hire somebody else ? 
you just have to control it .  we &apos;re not apes . 
puff ,  i &apos;m proud of you !  you did remarkably well under difficult circumstances . 
you were gone a long time . 
how the hell would you know anything about the human heart ? 
look at you two .  you both disgust me . 
this is great ,  puff .  you &apos;re doing fine . 
good .  remember ,  when in doubt :  don &apos;t ever do what you really want to do . 
thanks to you ,  nate . 
and of course to you ,  my sweet ,  for your .  .  .  moral support . 
unn . 
no ,  why ? 
oh ,  i see .  yes ,  that &apos;s something to think about .  that &apos;s very good .  that &apos;s what you get the big bucks ,  right ?  ha ha . 
wait ! 
pittsburgh ? 
it always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind .  are you sure you don &apos;t want anything ? 
i &apos;m ready . 
what makes you know so much ?  how do you know what eddie was thinking ? 
for what makes the world go round .  for money ,  and for glory . 
all right .  today for me ,  tomorrow for himself . 
you bastard . 
in a little while .  that &apos;s what you want ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
and the way you &apos;re looking at me ,  is that the way you look at a man you &apos;ve just beaten ?  as if you &apos;d just taken his money ,  and now all you want is .  .  .  his pride ? 
i like it .  it &apos;s good for you .  besides ,  you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing .  that &apos;s something you don &apos;t need  -  -  an excuse for losing .  how did you make out in the poker game ? 
character . 
eddie ,  is it all right if i get personal ? 
sure ,  you got drunk .  that &apos;s the best excuse in the world for losing .  no trouble losing when you got a good excuse .  and winning !  that can be heavy on your back too .  like a monkey .  you drop that load too when you got an excuse .  all you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself .  it &apos;s one of the best indoor sports :  feeling sorry for yourself  -  -  a sport enjoyed by all ,  especially the born losers . 
i never saw you do anything else . 
hey ,  wait .   what are you gonna do about the money ? 
ahh ,  slow .  .  .  why the open hand bridge ?  something wrong with your hand ?

do you like to gamble ,  eddie ?  gamble money on pool games ? 
boy ,  he is great !  jeez ,  that old fat man .  look at the way he moves .  like a dancer .

what do you want me to do ? 
are you all right ? 
david thought i was having an affair ,  which i wasn &apos;t . 
he still gets air sick ,  huh ?  in all of this i didn &apos;t get the chance to thank you two . 
i don &apos;t know how you put up with him . 
there &apos;s good news and bad news . 
you &apos;re in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch . 
i &apos;ve got a lock on the signal pattern .  we can filter it out . 
david ,  i &apos;ve been meaning to talk with you .  it &apos;s nice you &apos;ve been spending so much time with me ,  but .  .  .

oh ,  he &apos;s in austria .  a slight detour . 
marcus !   i did it ! 
but if you want facts ,  indy ,  i have none to give you .  at my age ,  i &apos;m prepared to take a few things on faith . 
henry !  what are you doing here ?  ! 
schneider ? 
are you expected ? 
well ,  it &apos;s sandstone .  christian symbol .  early latin text .  mid - twelfth century ,  i should think . 
let me tell you another  &quot; bedtime story ,  &quot;  doctor jones .  after the grail was entrusted to joseph of arimathaea ,  it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three knights of the first crusade .  three brothers ,  to be exact . 
this is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knight &apos;s story .  .  .  it doesn &apos;t reveal on location of the grail ,  i &apos;m afraid .  .  .  but the knight promised that two  &quot; markers &quot;  that had been left behind would .   this tablet is one of those  &quot; markers .  &quot;  it proves the knight &apos;s story is true .  but as you pointed out  -  -  it &apos;s incomplete .   now ,  the second  &quot; marker &quot;  is entombed with the knight &apos;s dead brother .  our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of venice ,  italy .   as you can now see ,  doctor jones ,  we &apos;re about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago .  we &apos;re only one step away . 
doctor jones ? 
it would make me very happy . 
the ark of the covenant . 
my room ! 
this . 
what are you going to do ? 
this one .  i think he &apos;s in here . 
is that what you think of me ?  i believe in the grail ,  not the swastika . 
elsa !  elsa ,  don &apos;t move ! 
elsa .  elsa don &apos;t .  elsa .  elsa .  give me your other hand ,  honey .  i can &apos;t hold you . 
but what are you doing here ? 
oh ,  it breaks the heart . 
they want my diary . 
she ransacked her own room and i fell for it .  how did you know she was a nazi ? 
how did you she was a nazi ? 
feels like a cigarette lighter . 
what ? 
this is intolerable ! 
dad ! 
come on ,  dad .  come on ! 
oh ,  yes .  but i found the clues that will safely take us through ,  in the chronicles of st .  anselm . 
i wrote them down in my diary so that i wouldn &apos;t have to remember . 
yes !  the only thing that matters is the grail . 
that &apos;s for blasphemy .  the quest for the grail is not archaeology .  it &apos;s a race against evil .  if it is captured by the nazis ,  the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth .  do you understand me ? 
what did you get ? 
we didn &apos;t talk .  we never talked . 
i didn &apos;t know you could fly a plane . 
this is intolerable ! 
now ,  who are all these people ? 
dad ? 
dad ?  ! 
the penitent man is humble before god . 
junior ,  give me your other hand !  i can &apos;t hold on !  ! 
why are you trying to kill us ? 
where is he ?  talk  -  -  or you &apos;re dead .  damn it ,  tell me !  tell me ! 
this is your last chance . 
all right !  where &apos;s my father
who are you ? 
captain blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the  &quot; natives &quot;  . 
you &apos;re hanging on better here than you did in america . 
the prime minister doesn &apos;t seem that naive . 
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s nothing .  just rumors .   what was it they claimed was stolen ? 
what ? 
you know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them . 
mola ram is telling the faithful of out victory .  he says the british have left the palace ,  which proves kali ma &apos;s new power . 
you never told me you spoke my language ,  dr .  jones . 
so ,  it is true ,  dr .  jones ?  you found nurhachi ? 
you have insulted my son . 
indy ,  they make our plane crash ?  to get you here ? 
there were five stones in the beginning .  over the centuries they were dispersed by wars ,  sold off by thieves like you .  .  . 
no .  they are here  -  -  somewhere .  a century ago when the british raided this temple and butchered my people ,  a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs . 
give me the stones ! 
on the way to delhi ,  you will stop at pankot . 
you will go to palace there . 
you will find them when you find sivlalinga . 
i like the service here . 
for crying out loud ,  a kid &apos;s driving the car ?  ! 
and then they took their children . 
hey ,  willie  -  -  i think you better get out now .

where &apos;d you find your little bodyguard ? 
he &apos;s afraid of something . 
five minutes .  .  .  you &apos;ll be back over here in five minutes .  .  . 
no  -  -  don &apos;t you see  -  -  crawling  -  - 
oh no  -  -  oh no !  ! 
get us out !  willie ,  shut up and listen !  there &apos;s got to be a fulcrum release !  look around ! 
oh god ,  it &apos;s soft  -  -  it &apos;s moving ! 
oh my god !  he ripped out his  -  -  he killed him ! 
it &apos;s okay .  you &apos;re all right now . 
try me . 
i &apos;m reporting you to the  .  .  .  .  . transit authority !  !  ! 
arrrgh !

i &apos;m not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head . 
don &apos;t do it ! 
what do you do about what ? 
and you ? 
i waited for you . 
i guess it &apos;s a combination you don &apos;t often see .  apparent attraction .  . 
 .  .  . and sort of .  .  . disinterest . 
but i don &apos;t listen .  .  . then i &apos;d be crazy . 
who do you work for ? 
trans ocean travel . 
no .  ryuji just hires us . 
why did they leave ? 
who did ? 
he stole something .  from a friend of mine . 
if gruner led us away ,  who &apos;d he lead us away from ? 
what ? 
that &apos;s not this direction .  it &apos;s back the other way . 
what did you tell them ? 
now what ? 
i knew it .  i told him . 
he told me what to do . 
must be a fulfilling occupation . 
joe doakes ?  it &apos;s quarter to 10 .  .  . 
wait . 
it &apos;s alright . 
yes . 
right there . 
that &apos;s great .  .  .  little early for cartoons ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
mom . 
just ran into two of your  &quot; geologists .  &quot;  geologists whose hands aren &apos;t all chewed up .  .  .  ? 
when &apos;s your deadline ? 
 &quot; tortious interference &quot;  ?  sounds like a disease caught by a radio . 
cbs does not do that .  and ,  you &apos;re questioning our journalistic integrity ?  ! 
you are a fanatic .  an anarchist .  you know that ?  if we can &apos;t have a whole show ,  then i want half a show rather than no show .  but oh ,  no ,  not you .  you won &apos;t be satisfied unless you &apos;re putting the company at risk ! 
so ,  now ,  if you &apos;ll excuse me ,  gentlemen ,  mr .  rather &apos;s been complaining about his chair again .   as they start to leave .  .  . 
a gun ?  yes . 
if this holds up ,  and it very well may not ,  mike .  .  .  but ,  if it did .  and we aired this segment ?  and cbs was sued by brown & williamson ?  i think we could be at grave risk . 
hey ,  lowell . 
well ,  until you do ,  all i can tell you is what you already know .  .  .  they will not air an interview . 
i can take her . 
what do you need at the store ? 
there &apos;s a severance agreement .  .  .  it includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage .  .  .   sure you don &apos;t need anything ? 
thank you ,  bob . 
oh ,  someone took a poll ?   &quot; are all things canadian boring .  .  .  ?  &quot; 
what ?  ! 
yeah .  .  . 
he referred to this .  .  .  the seven dwarfs .  .  . 
so ,  is everything okay ? 
lowell ! 
oh ,  how fortunate i am to have lowell bergman &apos;s moral tutelage to point me down the shining path .  to show me the way . 
that canada story ?  still interest you ? 
coffee ? 
who &apos;s that ? 
i know what i have to know . 
should i just take the documents now ? 
mrs .  wigand ,  how do you do ? 
what do .  .  . 
this is my house .  .  .  in front of my wife ,  my kids ?  !  what business do we have ? 
it happened after i talked to you .  i do not like coincidences ! 
and ,  i &apos;m unemployed .  so i have to protect my medical coverage .    .  .  . so i left them a message this morning .  their expanded confidentiality agreement ?  i will sign it . 
my father was a mechanical engineer .  .  .  most ingenious man i ever knew . 
i believe that ?  yes ,  i believe that . 
are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here ?  !  i never abandoned a source ! 
excuse me .  yeah .  .  . 
good .  but jeff .  .  . 
no ?  no ,  what ? 
i &apos;ve got to teach class .  i &apos;ve got to go .  i &apos;ve got to teach class . 
what are you talking about ? 
dr .  wigand .  i am instructing you .  .  .    .  .  . not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the brown & williamson tobacco company .  and in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the state of kentucky !  that means you don &apos;t talk !   mr .  motley ,  we have rights ,  here .  .  . 
you threatening my family ,  now ,  too ? 
your husband ,  who has beaten you  -  -  repeatedly  -  - 
no ! 
and without it ,  that party is exposed  -  -  a sitting duck .  no wriggle room . 
is this mr .  dumbarton ? 
that &apos;s his lawyer . 
yes .  the inability to experience pleasure . 
marylin rexroth .  she came into my office and signed a pre - nup with howard doyle . 
that was marvin untermeyer . 
what is your husband &apos;s profession ? 
you &apos;re vulnerable . 
these are yours . 
i &apos;ll have the tournedos of beef .  and the lady will have the same ?   i assume you &apos;re a carnivore . 
see the tape .  then we can discuss reconciliation .  rex screwed up and i nailed his ass .  now i &apos;m going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it .  then i &apos;m getting on with my life .  that &apos;s all i &apos;m after . 
okay .  should i stop at starbucks and pick up a blended for  -  - 
you have wonderful art .  i love that lithograph .  hockney ? 
no kidding .  i &apos;ll bet you have some very grateful clients .  what &apos;d rex buy you ? 
hmmm .  .  . 
friends ? 
i don &apos;t have a ring ! 
but ? 
i &apos;m sorry .  i &apos;m squishing you .  i &apos;ll move to the .  .  . 
i have a surprise for you . 
comfy ! 
i &apos;m reporting you to the irs . 
arty farty stuff .   lithographs and pre castro cubans .  watches and mileage on private jets .  stuff ,  miles .  stuff you get from grateful clients . 
i know .  so am i ,  right ?  and so is agent wilson of the internal revenue service .  he &apos;s a dedicated ,  underpaid graduate of southwestern university  -  -  very tenacious ,  and never more so than when he &apos;s dealing with an unscrupulous colleague .   i think it &apos;s only fair to warn you :  i &apos;m going to file an action ,  miles .  and after a decent interval i plan to have ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house . 
it &apos;s a no go ,  joe . 
pre - castro . 
are you alright ?  you lost weight . 
i &apos;m sorry .  where were we ? 
he told me to  -  -  he said he wanted me to  -  - 
is this ming ? 
soon ,  you &apos;ll have your own rage ! 
mr .  massey  -  - 
my client has ruled that out . 
where does that leave us ? 
mr .  rexroth . 
gotcha .  no need to get anatomically correct with me ,  rex . 
what &apos;s kirshner ? 
 .  .  . and i hear she &apos;s richer than croesus . 
yes .   it &apos;s for your protection ,  sweetheart .  you &apos;re the one with the  -  -  the .  .  . 
hi ,  sweetie . 
it &apos;s not so bad these days .  kids like joint custody .  two sets of toys . 
that doesn &apos;t make sense .  it &apos;s like punishing you for being goal oriented . 
what &apos;s the matter ?  anything wrong ? 
yes .  i know .  still in the dumps ,  huh ? 
can &apos;t you get them to go any faster ?   this dissolves to a deserted road ,  peter at the wheel of his car .  his high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing . 
i sold some drawers and socks ,  too; i &apos;m throwing those in . 
why not ?  i &apos;m not charging you for the time i wasted . 
what ten thousand ? 
listen ,  did anybody ever make a sucker out of you ?  this is a matter of principle .  something you probably wouldn &apos;t understand .   when somebody takes me for a buggy ride i don &apos;t like the idea of having to pay for the privilege . 
i might . 
come on ,  ellie .  stop being silly .  you know i &apos;m going to have my way . 
he &apos;s one of the best fliers in the country .  right now he &apos;s planning a trip to japan . 
i knocked several times . 
you &apos;ve been acting so strangely since you returned .  i &apos;mi &apos;m worried .  i haven &apos;t bothered to ask you any questionsi  isn &apos;t all this what you wanted ?   you haven &apos;t changed your mind about king ,  have you ? 
now ,  don &apos;t tell me you fell in love with a bus driver ! 
oh ,  come now
ridiculous ! 
fine man to fall in love with . 
looks like that was his only interest in me .  the reward . 
why should she ?  after all
what a hell cat .  no controlling these modern girls .   they &apos;re terrible ! 
you thought that up all by yourself ,  huh ? 
personally ,  i think it &apos;s stupid !   but go ahead .  have a good time .  as long as ellie doesn &apos;t object . 
me ?  forget it ,  son .   i got millions . 
whadda you want ! 
that storm sure made a mess outa these roads . 
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re raving about ,  young man .  and ,  furthermore ,  i &apos;m not interested . 
why ,  noi  yes  .   .   .  i guess i will . 
no .  i &apos;d rather you didn &apos;t . 
you &apos;ll never get away with it ,  miss andrews .  your father &apos;ll stop you before you get half way to new york . 
what for ? 
i never thought of that . 
here ,  boy ! 
i just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband . 
that ,  i suppose ,  makes everythinguhquite all right . 
do you mind joining the israelites ? 
you &apos;ve got a name ,  haven &apos;t you ? 
here
you &apos;ll find the showersand thingsright back of the second cottage .  
must be the spring . 
he apologized for last night .   said he didn &apos;t know we were married . 
yes ,  you do .  you think i &apos;m a fool and a spoiled brat .  perhaps i am ,  although i don &apos;t see how i can be .  people who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way .  i never have .  on the contrary ,  i &apos;ve always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom .  would you believe it ?  this is the first time i &apos;ve ever been alone with a man ! 
it &apos;s a wonder i &apos;m not panic stricken . 
i was never built for these moonlight strolls .   why did we have to leave the bus ? 
not a sou .  i had some before the fainting scene . 
must be some strange power westley has over you women .   how do you expect to get there ? 
peter
but what ! 
nothing .   nothing you &apos;d give two cents for . 
what &apos;d you say we &apos;re supposed to be doing ? 
i guess maybe i won &apos;t write that book after all . 
what &apos;d you give him for the car ? 
where &apos;s the bus to new york ? 
any of your passengers want a place to sleepthere &apos;s an auto camp up yonder a piece . 
did you know he reversed the charges on that call ? 
a thousand dollars !   get out of this office before i throw you out bodily . 
what ! 
who &apos;s she gonna marry ? 
they made me get  &apos;em a rope and a blanket ,  on a night like this . 
what do you reckon that &apos;s for ? 
go on .  go on send the telegram . 
thenyou &apos;ll have to git  ! 
huh ? 
what &apos;s the idea ? 
a gat !  a gat !   got any fireworks on you ? 
what else ,  stupid !  you don &apos;t think we &apos;re after that penny - ante reward ,  do you ?   ten thousand bucks ?  chicken feed !  we &apos;re holding her for a million smackers . 
sh - sh - sh !  soft pedal ,  you mug ! before i what &apos;re you trying to do ?  tell the whole world about it !   now listen ,  you &apos;re in this thingand you &apos;re staying in !  get me ?  you know too much . 
got a couple of kids ,  huh ? 
you love them ,  don &apos;t you ? 
you &apos;ll keep your trap shut ,  all right . 
if this is oswald ,  it must be our third oswald . 
why you keep dancing on my head for ,  my man ?   we been thicker &apos;n molasses pie since law school . 
right . 
when did you first do business with this bertrand ? 
all this blubbering over that sonofabitch !   they &apos;re grieving like they knew the man .   it makes me want to puke . 
well ,  the kid musta gone nuts ,  right ?   i said oswald must &apos;ve flipped .   just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him ,  right ? 
shaw .   clay shaw . 
morning ,  boys .   ready for a walking tour ? 
well ,  it &apos;s a terrific yard ,  chief ,  but the man &apos;s an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss . 
i still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this ,  boss .   susie &apos;s stuff is colorful ,  but .  .  . 
can you get some sworn statements ? 
if i &apos;m so far from the truth ,  why is the fbi bugging our offices ?   why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered ?   why are federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before ? 
 .  .  . ever called dean andrews ? 
it leads farther than that . 
i &apos;m caught in the middle .   they &apos;re after me .   it &apos;s almost over . 
dave ,  i always play square .   no bugs .  i &apos;d love you to go on the record ,  but i &quot; m in no hurry .   whenever you &apos;re ready . 
no particular reason .   just to go somewhere . 
i believe the boys got a couple . 
oh yes ,  well ,  come to think of it ,  they &apos;re right .   we got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them .   but you couldn &apos;t approach them .   they were a wise bunch of birds . 
then who killed the president ? 
i don &apos;t remember his name .   you must understand it was quite crowded ,  and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the president who is dead ,  you don &apos;t look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are . 
no ,  because there were others .   there were admirals . 
jesus ,  ed ,  from time immemorial it &apos;s been standard booking procedure to ask an alias .   you know that .   there &apos;s no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions . 
he asked me why i thought i was in danger and i said : 
he kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots .   he was getting hot under the collar ,  and telling the woman not to write when he wanted . 
i want the truth . 
none either .   it &apos;s bizarre .   it &apos;s next to impossible to get russian sweethearts out .   nor does lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to cuba and russia in  &apos;63 .   a man who has defected once already .   it &apos;s crazy . 
no . 
no ,  it was not .   do you know an attorney by the name of dean andrews ? 
this says  &quot; mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green ford pickup truck .  &quot;   that &apos;s not true .   i recognized him and i told them so .  .  .  they also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck ,  which it was not .   and here .  .  .    .  .  . on the dallas sheriff &apos;s report .  this is really strange .   see that notarized signature on the bottom of each page ?   that &apos;s not my signature .  and there never was any notary present during any of my questioning .   i guess that &apos;s all .  .  . 
i can &apos;t believe a man as intelligent as earl warren ever read what &apos;s in those volumes . 
i cannot believe this .   it &apos;s four -  thirty ,  jim garrison .   i have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and  .  .  . 
do you have any evidence against him ,  jim ?   clay shaw &apos;s done so much for the city with all that restoration in the quarter .   he &apos;s well connected ,  all his friends ,  the money ,  people ,  be careful ,  jim . 
because when i scheduled it i didn &apos;t realize it was a holiday .   you were there ,  why didn &apos;t you say something ? 
nothing is going to happen to you .  i won &apos;t let it . 
just a crank making phone calls .  happens a dozen times a day at the office . 
i &apos;ll take them up to my mother &apos;s if it &apos;ll make you feel better .   spend a week .   i &apos;ll change the locks ,  the phone lines ,  i &apos;ll even get a bodyguard ,  all right ?   elizabeth ,  get a hold of yourself . 
that &apos;s not why i &apos;m attacking him !  you don &apos;t believe me  -  all this time you never believed me . 
he won .  .  .  and they killed robert kennedy .   they shot him down . 
you realize the things you &apos;re saying ,  willie ,  are going to be attacked by a lot of different people . 
one little guy with a cheap rifle  -  look what he can do . 
i know david  -  a strange character . 
the office of naval intelligence . 
post office . 
mobbed up all the way .   tight with the dallas cops .   i &apos;m digging ,  chief .  i just need 10 more men and some more dollars . 
the key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other ,  and it takes a minimum 2 . 3 seconds to recycle this thing .   the other problem is there was a tree right there .  .  .   blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the zapruder film . 
when kennedy gets to the kill zone ,  it &apos;s a turkey shoot . 
you know who the mayor was ? 
general charles cabell .   deputy director of the cia .   fired by kennedy in  &apos;61 because of the bay of pigs fiasco ,  he moved back to the pentagon ,  called kennedy a  &quot; traitor &quot;  .   when he came to new orleans to address the foreign policy association ,  you know who introduced him ?   our friend clay shaw . 
i &apos;m glad you came .   i &apos;m sorry about the precautions . 
i could give you a false name ,  but i won &apos;t .   just call me x . 
he &apos;s done it before .   other countries .  lumumba in the congo ,  trujillo ,  the dominican republic ,  he &apos;s working on castro .   no big deal .   in september ,  kennedy announces the texas trip .  at that moment ,  second oswalds start popping up all over dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket .   y flies in the assassins ,  maybe from the special camp we keep outside athens ,  greece  -  pros ,  maybe some locals ,  cubans ,  maria hire ,  separate teams .   does it really matter who shot from what rooftop ?   part of the scenery .   the assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone .  .  . 
 .  .  . don &apos;t think so .   when they start to drool ,  they get rid of  &apos;em .   these guys are proud of what they did .  they did dealey plaza !   they took out the president of the united states !   that &apos;s entertainment !   and they served their country doing it . 
and he never hit you before ? 
how much more ? 
you have other information ? 
dave ferrie  -  you know about him ? 
sure .    &apos;course they hated the sonofabitch ,  but .  .  . 
even my own wife ,  chief ,   who &apos;s wondering where i am ? 
well ,  believe what you want ,  boss ,  but we got to be more careful .   all these new volunteers ,  any one of them could be .  .  . 
they &apos;ve been enlarged and show a lot of detail .  .  . 
that &apos;s all you &apos;ve had all this time ? 
virginia ,  you &apos;re a lucky little girl .  your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest .   would you like to be in a beauty contest ? 
and you get of from school at 3 every day ? 
then do you understand that i cannot tell the truth here ?   in dallas .  that there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth .  .  .  who do not want me to have a retrial ? 
i think i &apos;m gonna just get this for today .  i &apos;m in kind of a hurry .  would you mind ringing this up while i change out of it ? 
tomorrow i &apos;ll talk to your probation officer .  karen &apos;s a good kid ,  but she &apos;s mad at you ,  because you lied to her .  this business about your grandmother &apos;s funeral
i understand . 
won &apos;t forget ? 
naw ,  man .  they just tryin &apos; to put a fright in your ass . 
hey ,  c &apos;mon in ,  man .  i was just  -  -  you know  -  -  smokin &apos; a fatty ,  watchin &apos; tv . 
what &apos;d ya mean ? 
what ? 
aaaaawww man ,  i wasn &apos;t plannin &apos; on goin &apos; no place .  it &apos;s twelve o &apos;clock ,  man .  i &apos;m home ,  i &apos;m high  -  - 
uh - huh . 
fuck that shit ,  man .  i ain &apos;t shootin &apos; anybody . 
well ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  man ,  but i ain &apos;t gittin &apos; in that trunk . 
answer the question ,  nigga .  do you think i wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass ?  yes or no ? 
how &apos;d you know where he was ? 
i &apos;d say there &apos;s about ,  oh ,  fifty thousand dollars here .  what would you say ray ? 
what &apos;s she want ? 
the envelope contains currency .  .  .  all the same denomination ,  one - hundred -  dollar bills .  now ,  i &apos;m counting it . 
would i mind ?  do i have a choice ? 
hey ,  this is my office .  there &apos;s no smoking . 
help yourself . 
help us do what ? 
but now you &apos;re telling us now you do . 
you &apos;re not tired of it ? 
they wanted you to tell them what you know . 
you get a chance to use it ? 
thanks ,  but i have my own now . 
somebody loan it to you ? 
you never got into the whole cd revolution ? 
i don &apos;t know yet .  i &apos;m going to talk with dargus and nicolet today .  do what you suggested .  offer to help and see what happens . 
i want to talk to them first .  i know more now about ordell &apos;s money . 
he needs me .  without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in cabo .  sugar ? 
i &apos;m asking how you feel .  does it bother you ? 
really ? 
does something else worry you ? 
i called you last night . 
he tries to act cool . 
what about you max ? 
did you do it that night ? 
you &apos;re rationalizing . 
i told them ordell &apos;s changed the amount he &apos;s bringing in . 
what if he checks it ? 
then you &apos;re out and you get nothing . 
you &apos;re gonna have surveillance all over you . 
tell him i want to give him his money . 
sure i can &apos;t twist your arm ? 
he say we like the same thing as married . 
oh ,  miss brown ? 
look ,  that shit ain &apos;t mine .

 .  .  . compton with a fifty - six - year -  old petty thief  -  -  woman named simone hawkins . 
i smiled and walked away .  she also told me ordell killed beaumont . 
uh - huh . 
you said that the last time . 
i got there early .  i &apos;ve had my eye on this suit  -  -  wait ,  let &apos;s start over .  i got there early .  the idea was to try on the suit ,  see if i liked it .  if i did ,  get them to wrap it up ,  and change back into my uniform .  that &apos;s what sheronda &apos;s expecting me to wear .  go meet sheronda ,  give her the bag with fifty thousand ,  and go home . 
where &apos;s the bag she gave you ? 
what did you do after that ? 
sure . 
mr .  walker &apos;s my buddy .  ask him about ordell . 
he killed a guy who works for him the other day . 
you know how easy it would be ?  he won &apos;t be anywhere near that mall .  pull one more switch ,  up front .  that &apos;s it .  half - a - million dollars .  need help ? 
what &apos;s that fucker ever done for us ? 
are you getting that black suit ? 
it looks good on you . 
i put a little cherry on top .  you &apos;re right .  what the hell he ever do for us ? 
for what ? 
i &apos;magine they asked who you givin &apos; it to ,  too . 
i just came here to talk .

i was thinkin &apos; the del amo mall .  in the food court . 
look ,  it &apos;s my ass facin &apos; the penitentiary .  you send some hard -  headed roc whore ,  and she fucks things up . 
sheronda passin &apos; the money onto someone else ,  that &apos;s what the hell i &apos;m talkin &apos;  &apos;bout . 
i know ,  but i hung around ,   &apos;cause i figured you &apos;d try an &apos; pull some shit like this . 
she waits for you to go in the place where you try things on . 
that works on my nerves ,  you bein &apos; so buddy - buddy with him . 
he thinks he &apos;s joe gunn now . 
how long ? 
four years ? 
you &apos;re fourteen years old here ? 
were you a disco girl ? 
were you a disco guy ? 
that &apos;s a picture of me in japan . 
about five years ago . 
wanna fuck ? 
well ,  so far he is .  but you have to admit he &apos;s not too bright . 
that &apos;s not what i &apos;m saying at all .   you know where he went ? 
what are you doin &apos; ? 
i &apos;m carrying it . 
i &apos;m going to wait in the car .

i didn &apos;t really think anything of it .  no  -  -  i did wonder what he was doing there ,  but didn &apos;t think it had anything to do with us .  you know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend . 
you know the motherfucker &apos;s a bail bondsman ,  don &apos;t ya ?  you know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell ?

look .  i don &apos;t pretend to know what &apos;s going on inside your head .  for all i know it &apos;s pathological and they should be pumping valium into your veins by the quart .  but if you &apos;re not willing to accept the help of sci -  ence; and believe me ,  i admire you for that :  then you &apos;ll have to do bat -  tle on your own .  what can i say ?  it &apos;s a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls .  but to be pursued by  .  .  .  demons no less  .  .  .  there are no guides ,  jacob .   you wanna know what i &apos;d do if i sud -  denly started seeing demons ?  i &apos;d hail the first taxi that came along ,  shoot over to bellvue and beg them for shock treatment .  i &apos;m no saint .

sorry .  sometimes i think i &apos;m just gonna jump outta my skin .  they &apos;re just drivin &apos; me wild . 
i &apos;m afraid to go by myself anymore .  i keep thinkin &apos; one of  &apos;em &apos;s gonna come up behind me .  somethin &apos;s wrong when a guy can &apos;t even take a leak by himself .  i &apos;ve seen  &apos;em take people right off the street .  i used to go home a different way every night .  now i can &apos;t even go home . 
i &apos;m so sorry .  obviously you haven &apos;t  .  .  .  dr .  carlson died .

the ship &apos;s depressurizing ,  the engines overheating .  when it  reaches the core ,  we &apos;re done . 
blowing the walkway ?  you come up with that yourself ? 
where the hell were you ?  !  ! 
creepy . 
i &apos;ll need system four converters .

then what do we do ?  ! 
how do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn &apos;t carry something metal tits can &apos;t detect ? 
jesus what the hell is that ? 
sergeant ! 
i doubt that .  i think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us . 
where is everybody ?  what happened ? 
you just need to relax .  rizzo ti &apos;s the future .  we have soldiers on board ,  e - x grunts ,  the baddest of the bad .  .  . and their weapons ?  i &apos;m sure are slightly more advanced than what you &apos;re used to . 
don &apos;t just stand there !  shoot him ! 
my father &apos;s company imports and exports .  archaeology is part of the business .  we happen to get along just fine ,  smartass .  look ,  why don &apos;t you bust somebody else &apos;s balls for a change .

i &apos;m missing two ! 
you &apos;re so bossy . 
what do we do ?  !  ! 
i &apos;ll tell you where he is .  he &apos;s walking around this ship ,  killing anything that moves . 
no . 
any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental . 
the air &apos;s laced with type two ozone ,  it reads as a solid . 
the cryo unit leaked .  the computers sealed the room .  no airborne viruses no hazardous materials .  i &apos;ve shut down the until .  alright ,  stand back . 
almost done . 
oh ,  hush .  i disengaged your pain programming . 
sorry ,  sorry . 
leave him behind ! 
where .  .  ?  who  .   .   .  ?   i &apos;m alive .  you brought me back . 
jason !  can &apos;t you see ?  he did this . 
what have you done ? 
listen to me .  please .  let &apos;s get off thsi ship .  come with me . 
guys ,  he &apos;s right behind us ! 
my cars .  and a comic book . 
and my regular daily rate  -  -  $200 ,  whether we catch him or not . 
hey .  knock it off .  i don &apos;t want to have to listen to this while we &apos;re out there .  .  . 
look a &apos; that  -  -  bayonet iwo jima . 
he can &apos;t stay down with three barrels on him !  where is he ?  ! 
he &apos;s comin &apos; up  -  -   ! 
did you burn another kettle ?  y &apos;know you &apos;re a fire hazard ?  this is the third one ! 
you want to go through those ?   i &apos;m taking them to the thrift shop .  it &apos;s marcia vaughn &apos;s pet charity .  pick out what you want to keep  -  -  it &apos;s mostly your city clothes . 
you &apos;re very tight ,  y &apos;know ?   right there . 
why don &apos;t we have one more drink ,  you and i ,  and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what &apos;s inside him ,  or not . 
now tell me something i don &apos;t know . 
i don &apos;t think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things . 
i &apos;ll get to that in a minute .  first ,  i plan to start our seasonal summer help early ,  and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea .  i &apos;d like cooperation from local fishermen ,  and i &apos;ve also contacted the oceanographic institute over on the mainland . 
you &apos;d love to prove that .  getting your name in the national geographic . 
there &apos;s only one thing you &apos;re good for anymore  -  -  signing a damn voucher .  here .  it &apos;s an authorization to employ a contractor . 
left arm ,  head ,  shoulders ,  sternum and portions of ribcage intact .   please don &apos;t smoke .  with minor post -  mortem lacerations and abrasions .  bite marks indicate typical non - frenzy feeding pattern of large squali ,  possibly carchaninus lonimanus ,  or isurus glaucas .  gross tissue loss and post - mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however ,  teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters .    -  -  did you go out in a boat and look around ? 
there &apos;s a kind of a lone shark ,  called ,  uh .  .  . 
yeah .  rogue .  picks out an area where there &apos;s food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts ? 
and before 1900 ,  when people first starting swimming for recreation ,  before public bathing and resorts ,  there were very few shark attacks ,  cause sharks didn &apos;t know what they were missing ? 
 .  .  . and it was dartmouth winter weekend ,  and she was homecoming queen ,  and i was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family ,  and she was right  -  -  her great - grandfather was in mining ,  and my ancestors were yankee shipbuilders .  so we broke up and i went home with some beatnik from sarah lawrence . 
you &apos;re at the institute full time ?  or do you have a job ? 
we will .  there &apos;s something i &apos;ve got to find out . 
wait a minute !  i need you . 
this has got to be one big violation .  .  . 
christine what ? 
 .  .  . and bill mayhew almost caught him in his net .  .  .  ? 
i &apos;d like to tell you what we &apos;re doing so far .  these are some of the steps i &apos;ve taken as chief of police .  .  . 
look at him take it ! 
yep . 
and i &apos;m not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark .  i &apos;m talking about a great white . 
hello ,  junior .  what are you ?  some kind of half - assed astronaut ?   jesus christ ,  when i was a kid ,  every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman .  what d &apos;ya have there  -  -  a portable shower ? 
i don &apos;t know what it is ,  but it &apos;s not a shark . 
a marlin ,  or a stingray .  huh .  don &apos;t ever tell me my business again .  get back up on the bridge . 
bull shark scraped me while i was taking samples .  .  . 
easy !  it &apos;ll tear right out ! 
carcaradon carcharias .  a great white . 
you ran eight miles today ,  puppy . 
juno macguff called while you were out running .  she wants to know if you &apos;re coming to her little coffeehouse performance on saturday . 
you know how i feel about her . 
go carole .   so ,  guess what ? 
yeah ,  typically .  that &apos;s what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant . 
yeah ,  wizard ,  i guess .  i mean do what you think is right . 
so ,  it looks like you &apos;re getting pregnant - er these days . 
jesus ,  bleek . 
we could get back together too . 
well ,  we were once .  you know ,  that time . 
wait ,  let me take that . 
wizard ! 
that was my first instinct too .  or d . w . i .  anything but this .  and i &apos;m going to punch that bleeker kid in the weiner the next time i see him . 
no .  the school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion . 
oh ,  god .  .  . 
you could have sent it to them .  why would you drive an hour out to east jesus ,  nowhere ? 
you mean i have to wait for it to get even worse ?  why can &apos;t they just give it to me now ? 
you know ,  you &apos;ve been acting like this ever since i went up to see my brother at mankato .  i told you ,  nothing happened ! 
what ?  my eyes are not lying ! 
oh .  that &apos;s ,  uh ,  my room .  vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff . 
why aren &apos;t you at work ? 
i think it kind of looks like my friend ,  paulie . 
well ,  it can really only go two ways . 
we definitely want it to have junk . 
what is it ? 
don &apos;t you remember you told me you loved me ,  baby .  .  . 
this is even better than suspiria .  you &apos;ve got decent taste in slasher movies ,  mark . 
my dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with greek and roman mythology .  he named me after zeus &apos;s wife .  i mean ,  zeus had other lays ,  but i &apos;m pretty sure juno was his only wife .  she was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean .  like diana ross . 
cute ? 
i &apos;m dying to see what you &apos;ve got to teach me . 
cool . 
only squares and nerds go to dances . 
this .  .  .    .  .  . this is what my life has become .  stuff in boxes .  stuff underground .  is that so appealing to you ? 
sure .  the powder room down here is being re - tiled ,  but you can use the master bath upstairs .  go up ,  then turn left and on your right .  .  . 
juno !  god ,  you startled me .  what are you doing here ?  what &apos;s wrong ? 
my partner uses these every time we have intercourse .  they make his balls smell like pie . 
they say they &apos;re going to pay my medical expenses and everything .  i promise this will all be resolved in thirty - odd weeks ,  and we can pretend it never happened . 
hi dad . 
yeah ,  she does . 
well ,  well .  if it isn &apos;t macguff the crime dog !  back for another test ? 
heavy lifting can only help you at this point . 
the penny saver sucks . 
that &apos;s her .  that &apos;s vanessa loring . 
no way !  she &apos;s pretty . 
he asked her .  i heard they were going to benihana ,  then the prom ,  then to vijay &apos;s parents &apos; cabin . 
i wouldn &apos;t be so sure about that .  he did it with you .  he &apos;s a man now . 
you &apos;re doing an amazing and selfless thing for us . 
well ,  i wanted to pick something gender - neutral for now .  once we get the baby ,  god willing ,  we can create a more decisive palette . 
i think i &apos;m leaning toward custard in this light .  i don &apos;t know .  i should paint a small area .  .  . 
that wall is going to need something .  maybe we could put our first family picture there . 
what would be a good time for you ? 
have you found a place to stay ? 
i &apos;m cool . 
geez ,  they look kinda weird . 
never heard of it ,  any huntin &apos; ? 
can &apos;t hurt . 
that bad ? 
by the way ,  i &apos;m not much of a pool player . 
 .  .  . well i probably drunk more than my share ,  anyway .  .  .  you go on an &apos; have it . 
so tell me .  .  .  what happened here ? 
 .  .  . and ? 
okay ,  now you want to talk about good versus evil ?  well then let &apos;s start with adam and eve and the snake . 
just being there where it really happened .  it was different .  .  .  more visceral . 
then you can write anywhere .  let &apos;s get out of here ,  while we still can . 
no we can &apos;t .  we can never leave once you start talking about tenure .  .  .  and vacation pay .  .  .  and parking privileges and .  .  .  oh shit !  let &apos;s just go to california now ,  right now ,  before it &apos;s too late . 
i like that . 
oh ,  yeah .  .  .  he had a real thick accent right outta  &quot; deliverance .  &quot;    &quot; still ?  who said anything about a still ?  get ya ass up in them woods !  &quot; 
you mean because i object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while i &apos;m eating i &apos;m prejudiced ? 
 .  .  . and all i &apos;m saying is i think we ought to try and get along with them .  that &apos;s all . 
carrie . 
all set ? 
you gotta talk to her .  she looks up to you ,  she &apos;ll listen to you . 
carrie ,  watch for early . 
what about you ? 
he &apos;s a killer ,  brian .  .  .  he &apos;s fucking insane . 
you &apos;re supposed to call me when you lose your job early .  i stopped by the mirror factory today ,  you left quite a mess behind there . 
 .  .  . the police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death .  and no doubt god &apos;ll be pickin &apos; on you on judgement day .  .  . 
what about the owner of the house .  .  .    .  .  . this john diebold ,  any idea where he might be ? 
you &apos;re clean . 
what do you think ? 
i knew you fucked it !  i sat out here for like two hours !  that girl was like twelve ,  and you hit it up ! 
well ,  i was flipping through a picture book of her and her family ,  right . 
i &apos;m telling you casper .  i think i &apos;m getting addicted to that shit . 
probably . 
it is right . 
you thirsty ? 
and once i saw this episode where they pretended they were each other .  where they lived the other &apos;s life for a day .  you know those guys share everything ,  right ? 
and it got me thinkin &apos; .  how fun it would be to share each other &apos;s girl . 
that girl you boned last year .  remember ? 
man ,  this guy is really good . 
she was handing out those watermelon slices .  and i sat down over on the other side ,  and i watched her . 
at that moment ,  at that block party ,  she represented everything holy about a virgin . 
you wanna run by the park and see what everybody &apos;s doing ?  get zooted ? 
yeah .  why you give money . 
yo ,  you think we killed that guy ? 
no i &apos;m serious .  can i suck your tit ?  either of you guys .  i don &apos;t care . 
yeah watch the fuck where you skate .  you know what i &apos;m saying ? 
ooh .  you &apos;re gonna give me goose bumps . 
no .  i can &apos;t .  my mom won &apos;t let me have boyfriends . 
you should come back with me to steven &apos;s house . 
yeah .  his parents are away .  it &apos;s gonna be a bug out . 
nothing .  i &apos;m telling you i just want to make you happy .  that &apos;s all .  just trust me . 
jennie ,  jennie .  how do you feel ? 
because i like you .  i think you &apos;re beautiful .  i think if we fucked you would love it .  you wouldn &apos;t even believe it . 
how many people have you had vaginal intercourse with ? 
jennie .  you &apos;ve tested positive for the hiv infection . 
miss ,  would i be prying ? 
yeah .  i &apos;m not saying you should get a tattoo .  but you should make yourself happy . 
is telly there ?  this is paul .  who is this ? 
did you bleed ? 
right .  you &apos;re like it &apos;s just this instinct .  it &apos;s like this animal instinct is taking over you .  it &apos;s like .  .  . 
yep ,  yep .  but he has to know what he &apos;s doing and where he &apos;s going .  because they can like touch you for hours and they won &apos;t ever know . 
i gotta go .  i gotta find telly . 
you know .  .  .  you know a lot of times sex gets in the way .  has that ever happened to you ? 
yep .  that &apos;s the best way .  it &apos;s that boom boom boom . 
yep . 
i &apos;ve known the past of all the people i &apos;ve fucked without a condom .  like i know one of the people got tested and was negative . 
i made her get tested with me because i didn &apos;t want to go alone . 
yep . 
sorry .  dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job . 
hey mom .  are you sure i can &apos;t get any money ?  just a few bucks . 
so ,  how many people live here now ? 
where does everyone sleep ? 
that &apos;s the whole thing .  you know if you look at it .  i mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that .  and everyone &apos;s dying .  and you better wear a condom or else .  but the truth is .  i don &apos;t know any kids with aids .  no one i know has ever died from that shit .  it &apos;s like some weird make - believe story that the whole world believes . 
slow . 
yeah . 
what &apos;s that supposed to mean ? 
all you gotta do is look at the map . 
he &apos;s not talking about himself . 
you set yourself up tonight when you attacked kathy ,  you crazy fuck ! 
sorry to ruin your trip to the city ,  but we got a real nut on our hands ,  frank . 
debi rutlege .   female .   caucasian .  twenty four .   worked over at the four oaks hotel . 
take it easy .   both of you . 
we &apos;ve checked .   there &apos;s no one with the last name of emma on the island . 
i was with him the whole time until i got the call at the hotel . 
it doesn &apos;t make sense because we don &apos;t understand it . 
i did another one last night .   you might have saved her ,  but you didn &apos;t want to play . 
i suppose you want to know where i &apos;m going to kill tonight ,  peter ? 
just for that no hint today . 
and you want these girls to feel your pain ? 
what ? 
yes ? 
it &apos;s me you want .   not her . 
i &apos;ll give you anything you want .  anything !   please ! 
i was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die  -  -  but i &apos;ve decided it &apos;s better if you don &apos;t know exactly when i kill her .  good - bye peter . 
yes ,  i do .   i found your file .   i know what happened . 
no problem .   we &apos;re in . 
it worked out alright ,  didn &apos;t it ? 
kathy ,  please .   you &apos;re going to wear a hole in the carpet . 
that &apos;s only because you don &apos;t know where to go .   you like hiking ?   fishing ?   sailing ?   what do you like ? 
who told you that ? 
whaddaya got ,  nolan ? 
there &apos;s no blood .   where &apos;s the fuckin &apos; blood ? 
you mean ,  no prints but hers ? 
he tapes their mouths shut .   we found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths .   we &apos;re doing a chemical analysis for components ,  but it &apos;s probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store . 
how long she been dead ? 
he &apos;s right ,  kathy . 
he &apos;s using the map as a chessboard !  the sonofabitch is playing chess with me !  ! 
a shadow .   what &apos;s as big a castle ?   as light as air  ,  but one hundred men can &apos;t move it ?   the shadow of the castle .   are there any buildings that have the name castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building ? 
we got a problem ? 
of course .   yes ,  here it is .   why ,  they &apos;re all the same ? 
sorry .   i thought it was empty . 
i love this hotel .   i stay here every time i visit my parents . 
are you with the tournament ? 
are you one of the players ? 
sounds very violent . 
i thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess . 
well ,  i think i &apos;ve had enough . 
we need your help . 
it wasn &apos;t intentional . 
in a way . 
this frightens me  -  -  because i &apos;m starting to feel things i haven &apos;t felt in a long time . 
you can turn everything around so easily .   this is not just another game ,  is it ? 
you . 
peter .  .  . 
you &apos;re wife died .   you can &apos;t feel responsible for that . 
then help me to understand .   i want to understand . 
this letter .   i &apos;ve never opened it . 
how did you know it was  &quot; carefully &quot;  ? 
hello ,  peter .   you played an interesting game last night .   even though sacrificing your queen at b - 5 is the game i played against valsney in  &apos;82 .   i &apos;m glad it helped you . 
i &apos;m not nervous . 
lyssa .  where are they keeping you ? 
where is the fortress ? 
you &apos;ll both wait .  at least for five hours .  the wedding is at three . 
she can &apos;t see out .  she can &apos;t tell us where the fortress is . 
she was very faint .  i was barely able to reach her . 
yes . 
lyssa ?  why< / u> ? 
never . 
from here ,  i must go alone . 
she &apos;s on the other side of this wall .  i can feel it ! 
slayers ! 
do not let the waters touch you . 
even by you ? 
yes .  it will double our range .   i know at least a dozen ways to get horses .  all cheap . 
make for the wall .  i &apos;ll catch up . 
you ! 
sugarballs ? 
sir ergo ?   .  .  .  my honorable lord ergo ?   .  .  . 
but also very young .  six to one is no odds ,  boy . 
food for crows . 
i am being exploited !  where are you going ? 
look at its beauty .  look at its grace . 
my spells always go wrong when i am observed .  be gone ! 
i do not want your power .  it is hideous . 
it is fifty years since i heard that name . 
i was beautiful then . 
do not try your trickery on me ! 
memory is no trick ,  it is a power .  the power to see . 
give me his name ,  i will mail him . 
well .  .  .  did you sleep with him or not ? 
 .  .  . good .  .  .   but what &apos;s special in him ? 
take .  .  . 
here ,  this is the light scoop for night shooting .  there ,  you fix client &apos;s distance .  .  .  how much to the bench down there in the park ? 
good !  first shot ! 
it &apos;s strange ,  being in love .  .  .  it &apos;s the first time for me .  .  . 
not taken .

let &apos;s face it ,  what the fuck are you doing in las vegas ? 
well  -  -  i was prepared for worse ,  but it wasn &apos;t so bad .  we were sitting at the bar ,  talking about blackjack .  you seemed just fine ,  a little drunker than usual ,  but nothing really strange ,  but then your head started to droop and i put my arm on your shoulder and then ,  wham ,  you swung you arm at me ,  and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress .  you smashed everything on her tray ,  it was a real mess .  you kept yelling and yelling . 
i told them you were an alcoholic and i would take you home .  i also promised that we would never come in there again . 
thank you ,  sera . 
years ago ,  in la ,  i turned a trick on sunset and western .  the guy was polite and didn &apos;t argue about the price .  he parked his car and i took him to a house that i had an arrangement with .  a fat mexican woman was watching a tv and i told him to give her the twenty for the room .  there were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room .  the room had a bed and a dresser .  he lay on his back on the bed and i put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then i eased on to him .  about twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up .  i felt kind of guilty because he hadn &apos;t come and i offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes ,  but he said it was all right and began dressing .  when we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and .  .  .  hugged me and kissed me on the cheek .  he gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car .  i remember being relieved that i wouldn &apos;t have to work again that evening . 
where was that house ?  the one in la ,  i mean . 
i &apos;ve missed the best sun .  why did you have to pawn your watch ? 
maybe it &apos;s time i moved to a hotel . 
where are you staying ?

i loved him ! 
were you with another man ?

it &apos;s so shameful .  .  . 
i have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the brooke &apos;s butt buster workout . 
i got out of the shower ,  walked downstairs ,  saw her standing over my father ,  and called the police . 
okay  -  -  ms .  windham ,  when you uh arrived back at the house ?  was your father there ? 
and when you came downstairs ,  what happened ? 
did you get it ? 
i &apos;m sorry ,  but  -  - 
you &apos;re hitting on me ?

and after they set his nose ,  he came back for his truck and i offered to drive for him since he was still on pain - killers and we spent the whole afternoon together !  he was unconscious for part of it ,  but it was really fun ! 
what if  -  -  you know  -  -  it &apos;s not the night ? 
once warner sees me as a serious law student ,  he &apos;ll want me back .  it &apos;s a completely brilliant plan !

then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said ,   &quot; oh ,  somebody &apos;s been sleeping in my bed .  &quot;  and then the mama bear said ,   &quot; oh dear ,  somebody &apos;s been sleeping in my bed !  &quot;  and then the big papa bear ,  he roared ,   &quot; and somebody &apos;s been sleeping in my bed !  &quot;  well ,  you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary ! 
they were in a quandary ,  and
well ,  that &apos;s that ,  i guess . 
chalmers bryant ! 
huh ? 
hey ,  what &apos;s happened to you ? 
i see .  you &apos;re afraid of going to jail ,  eh ? 
for a man who talks a great deal ,  it &apos;s amazing how unenlightening you can be . 
centuries !  where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures ? 
i surprise you ?  now that &apos;s news . 
one moment .  you say the high lama is the only one who can give us any information ? 
leave shangri - la !  that &apos;s not likely .  you couldn &apos;t drive her out . 
you shouldn &apos;t be looking at the bottom of the mountain .  why don &apos;t you try looking up at the top sometimes ? 
no porters here !  ! 
what exactly do you mean by  &quot; almost any time now &quot;  ? 
oh ,  thank you .  thank you ! 
in that event ,  we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately .  some means to get us back to civilization . 
a fine trick !  smart ,  aren &apos;t you ?  what a pack of lies you told us about those porters !  of course the minute they arrive ,  we can make arrangements to leave .  if they take us .  but you knew very well you &apos;d tell them not to ! 
it &apos;s all your fault !  it was all arranged until he spoke to you !  why can &apos;t you leave us alone ? 
i &apos;ll die if i have to stay here another minute !  i &apos;ve waited a long time for this chance to go ,  and you &apos;re not going to stop me now .  if i have to ,  i &apos;ll go alone .  it was i who bribed the porters .  if it weren &apos;t for me ,  you &apos;d never get out ! 
sit here ,  near me .  i am an old man and can do no one any harm . 
i trust you have been comfortable at shangri - la ,  since your arrival . 
you &apos;re the man chang told me about !  you &apos;re the first  -  who  -  two hundred years ago  you &apos;re still alive ,  father perrault ! 
you must not look to me for help .  your brother is no longer my problem .  he is now your problem ,  conway . 
bob ,  these are all that are left . 
hurray ! 
hello ,  freshie .  did you make that report out yet ? 
don &apos;t worry ,  george .  nothing &apos;s going to happen .  i &apos;ll fall right into line .  i &apos;ll be the good little boy that everybody wants me to be .  i &apos;ll be the best little foreign secretary we ever had ,  just because i haven &apos;t the nerve to be anything else . 
oh ,  stop it ! 
george ,  what are you going to do ? 
what is it ?  has he fainted ? 
we &apos;ve had plenty of it the last few days . 
well ,  we haven &apos;t been murdered in our beds yet ,  george ,  have we ? 
what else could it mean to me ?  it &apos;s obviously a lot of bunk . 
george ,  are you sure of the porters ?  about their taking care of you ,  i mean ? 
so everyone is serenely happy in shangri - la ?  nobody would ever think of leaving ?   it &apos;s all just so much rot !  she &apos;s pleaded with me ever since i came here to take her away from this awful place .  she &apos;s cried in my arms for hours ,  for fear i &apos;d leave her behind .  and what &apos;s more ,  she &apos;s made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters  -  for me ! 
she was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were ,  bob . 
the clothes ? 
lucky thing for me you snapped out of it ,  too .  you saved my life .  i never could have made it alone . 
where were you hiding ? 
good . 
what do you suggest ? 
imagine having all that fuel there ,  waiting for us !   george ,  something tells me our journey is just beginning . 
huh ?  i give it up .  but this not knowing where you &apos;re going is exciting anyway . 
yes . 
thank you . 
i &apos;m thirty . 
what is ? 
i &apos;m sorry .  i thought i was to be the light .  but why do i confuse you ?  am i so strange ? 
i &apos;m so glad . 
ouch ! 
would you like to wring my little neck ? 
be quiet !  fenner &apos;s the best pilot in china .  he knows what he &apos;s doing . 
why ,  he &apos;s speaking english . 
you &apos;ll wait till you rot ! 
i &apos;ll make some for you !   you will come today ? 
sir ,  before you boot me ,  i just want to explain .   i mean ,  okay ,  you got a goat - guy with a hook for a head .  .  . 
so .  .  .  this door .   it &apos;s .  .  .  not an exit .  .  .    ? 
well .  .  .  you know ,  when you say  &quot; normal ,  &quot;  what ,  exactly .  .  . 
sir .   i thought those records were sealed . 
everybody ,  listen up :  we &apos;ve had a tremendous amount of movement lately .  be aware .   be safe .   have a good day .   oh ,  uh .  .  .  cowan ? 
bull .  .  .  loney -  sir .   i &apos;m sorry .   sir ,  i &apos;m sorry .  sir .   i just ,  i find it hard to believe that it didn &apos;t come from you .   i mean ,  everything here comes from you . 
look .  i don &apos;t know why .   i could guess ,  however .   maybe it &apos;s your attitude .   or that you &apos;re not even close to a team player .   or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors . 
you do ? 
mikey .   hold it ,  mikey -  -  i want you to talk to me .   mikey .   i &apos;m telling you .  .  don &apos;t make me .  .  .  mikey   gimme the 140 . 
we &apos;ll take it from here . 
this is a neurelyser .  it was a gift from some friends from out of town .  i need you to look at it .   this red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain .   more specifically ,  the ones  - for memory ,  which it will then block .    i said i need you to look right here . 
i tell you ,  if we really wanted to bland in ,  that &apos;d what we &apos;d be wearing .   i think it &apos;d be a good look for you ,  too .   i &apos;ll even help you choose a tattoo . 
i &apos;m just saying it was cold .   i think she kind of liked me . 
what &apos;d you do before this ,  anyway ?  wait -  -  let me guess .  ice sculpture ?  rock ? 
jeebs is eager to have me deport him .  but would rather kill himself than go downtown .  why ? 
the radio show ? 
jesus .  .  . 
 &quot; perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs .  .  .  &quot; 
in case i need it ? 
i &apos;m just wondering what &apos;s so great out there that everyone &apos;s trying to get to it ? 
yeah .   his dream and our worst nightmare . 
i put word out -  -  you know how long it takes to get the signals across . 
once -  -  just once -  -  i thought i &apos;d made the discovery of a lifetime .  .  . 
and i &apos;m arranging deportation papers . 
let &apos;s go ,  jeebs .   downtown . 
goodwill .  .  . 
listen to me .  you &apos;re holding something very very dangerous .  you &apos;ve just iced 350 of your pals -  - 
this it ? 
hard to tell .   i hope not . 
i &apos;m getting a trajectory .  .  . 
and they &apos;re buying it ? 
now ,  what are we looking at ?   keys .   look at them all .   why do we have them ?   mr .  president ? 
wally ! 
i &apos;m sorry ,  but i need your help .  you contain information .   i need to know how to get it .   can you just tell me who leo crow is ?   can you tell me if  -  - 
what ? 
the other two will die without me . 
can &apos;t you see ?   she just wanted her little girl back . 
she &apos;s not alive ,  but she didn &apos;t die . 
 -  -  but he didn &apos;t . 
i &apos;m so sorry .  .  .  i just want him back .  .  .  i want him back so bad .  .  . 
you do understand i can &apos;t just give you new irises .   the scanners will read the scar tissue .   alarms will go off .   large men with guns will appear .  .  . 
that &apos;s not much . 
from where ?   d . c .  ? 
i put you away  -  - 
it goes from the bathroom to the kitchen . 
kill type ? 
that &apos;s an old one .   one of our first . 
you &apos;re part of my flock now ,  john .  welcome . 
has the observer from justice shown up yet ? 
and this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it . 
you can let him look around ,  answer his questions ,  but watch him .   if there &apos;s any problems ,  make sure we know about it first . 
lara called me . 
you know i can &apos;t do that .   you can &apos;t do that .  .  .   lamar ,  i need you to talk to wally ,  see if witwer &apos;s gone inside the temple again .   then ask jad for any off hour eyedents into the analytical room  -  - 
people want to believe in the system .   that &apos;s the beauty of it .  .  . 
victims are pronounced here .  killers here .   we never touch anything . 
got him in the foxhall .   4421 gainsborough . 
go ahead . 
the precogs don &apos;t see what you intend to do ,  only what you will do . 
to them . 
if it &apos;s a question of authority . 
but you call this room the  &quot; temple &quot;  . 
it seems i &apos;ve found a flaw ,  john  you . 
she spoke to me . 
she &apos;s a precog ? 
she &apos;s got information inside of her .   i need you to get it out . 
i tell you what .   i do this ,  i get to keep whatever images i get from her head . 
what happened ?   where &apos;s the rest ? 
who are you ? 
it floated back up .   i had to take him out and  -  - 
you &apos;re not gonna kill me ? 
look ,  i &apos;ve put my family through enough misery .   you gotta kill me !  this way i can leave  &apos;em something . 
you have three minutes to tell me what you &apos;re doing here before i feed you to a few of my more predacious plants . 
what &apos;s so funny ? 
and ,  yet ,  a chain of events has started .   a chain that will lead inexorably to his death . 
what ? 
you &apos;re saying that i &apos;ve halo &apos;d innocent people ? 
answer my question .   did lamar burgess know about the minority report ? 
what safe place is that ? 
 -  -  and then walk out . 
then how did he  -  - 
who ? 
john said something about him being set up because he  &quot; found out about her .  &quot; 
sir ,  the press conference is starting . 
you have an emergency call on your private line . 
oh ,  it &apos;s all my damn business now ,  lamar .   investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction .  .  .  so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy .   he &apos;s my suspect . 
according to the sentry ,  anderton was watching this at containment right before he was tagged . 
by fooling the system .   all someone would have to do is wait for precrime to stop the murder from taking place ,  then ,  a few minutes later ,  commit the crime in exactly the same way . 
precog deja vu .  .  . 
can &apos;t they shut that off ? 
anderton &apos;s smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can &apos;t id him to pick his pocket .   there &apos;s fewer consumers down there ,  which means fewer scanners to target him . 
there a maid in this hotel ? 
why don &apos;t i feel like celebrating ? 
he looks familiar . 
the man across the street .   i &apos;ve seen him before .  .  . 
what about your meeting ? 
i like it . 
he took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies .   this is all in your statement ,  lara .  .  . 
they &apos;ve never been separated before . 
what do you think ?   so he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it . 
wally ,  the other two can still function ,  right ? 
he &apos;ll be a minute ,  hon .  you want some coffee ? 
now ,  mr .  slade ,  you &apos;re in room 315 . 
all the suites are about the same . 
honestly ,  the suites are all about the same . 
as far as .  .  .  ? 
so ,  wait ,  you &apos;re from where ? 
i don &apos;t get it .  what do you do ? 
i don &apos;t know about you guys ,  but i &apos;m starting to feel a really sexual vibe here . 
i know . 
i got news for you ,  horrace got his ass out of there before you did . 
ricky &apos;s not wearing one . 
a elephant seal .  where &apos;s mommy ? 
hello . 
no . 
will you cut it out !  get ready ,  we &apos;re already late . 
she &apos;s downstairs with ruth .  get ready .

she needs a family .  a dad .  i &apos;ll give her what you never had . 
get your hands off of her . 
your dance is over .

c &apos;mon girl .  eat up . 
when &apos;s it going down ? 
heard of them . 
this is it . 
never won a race .  but it got me in with the trainer .  we &apos;d have a thing ,  i don &apos;t remember ,  some fucking thing .  the jockey would raise his whip ,  it meant the fix was in ,  we &apos;d all go running .  people get greedy .  first they bet small ,  they keep their mouth shut .  within a month &apos;s time ,  everyone and their brother was in on it .  the odds would drop ,  i mean you could watch the goddamn board .  it looked like a fuckin stopwatch ,  the odds would drop so fast . 
it &apos;s my fault .  i send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life ,  then i wonder why you seered .  it &apos;s my fault .  the tooth is on me .  but no more .  i &apos;m  &apos;reassigning &apos; you . 
who the fuck do you think you &apos;re talking to ?  this ain &apos;t a fucking democracy .  you want out ? 
don &apos;t i put food on you &apos;re table ?  i sponsor your training ,  i take care of your girl and her little baby .  i even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom . 
yes ,  for expenses and such .  now ,  you &apos;ll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go .  you each have been given an extra battery ,  so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned .  am i making myself abundantly clear ? 
i already told you ,  i parked it for five minutes and i locked it with the club  -  - 
nah . 
no .  just the cross streets . 
yeah .  .  .  mmmm ,  that sounds good .  .  .  uhu .  .  . 
any time ,  bro .

i want to leave right now . 
watch out ,  man .  sorry .  i &apos;m on the list ,  man .   hey ,  bro .

when you gonna get married ,  marty ?  you should be ashamed of yourself .  all your brothers and sisters ,  they all younger than you ,  they married and they got children .  i just saw your mother inna fruit shop ,  and she says to me ,   &quot; hey ,  you know a nice girl for my boy marty ?  &quot;  watsa matter with you ?  that &apos;s no way .  now you get married . 
i just wanna thank you people again ,  because the situation was just becoming impossible . 
aunt theresa ,  we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you &apos;re very lonely ,  see ?  and wouldn &apos;t she come and keep you company ,  because that way ,  you see .  .  . 
i &apos;m sorry we gotta rush like this .  .  . 
well ,  i &apos;ll tell you ,  aunt theresa .  .  . 
okay . 
 .  .  . you hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time ! 
what do you want me to do ? 
what do i do with it hawk ?  this is a little out of my line . 
y &apos;all were short a couple cutters and we &apos;re what the army sent . 
reckon so ,  but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite . 
good .  you &apos;ve both been working close to the front . 
which hospital ? 
is there any reason why we shouldn &apos;t know the name of it ? 
you  must  open  me  up  again ? 
i don &apos;t believe it &apos;s right for you to involve a boy who &apos;s not seventeen years old yet .  .  . 
we got to stop them right here . 
christ almighty ,  i think he means it ! 
what &apos;s that ? 
that there frank burns is a menace .  whenever a patient croaks on him it &apos;s either god &apos;s will or somebody else &apos;s fault . 
i guess that &apos;s why you go for hot lips houlihan . 
never heard of him . 
don &apos;t try to get it far down .  kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son - ofa - bitch . 
me ,  too .  y &apos;all just seen me play my last game . 
but no short - arm inspection .  i &apos;m with you there . 
there &apos;s no point appealing to colonel blake .  they &apos;ve got him bewitched . 
ravenous .  what about you ? 
 .  .  . and for our young men on the field of battle ,  that they may return home to their dear ones .  .  . 
you betcher ass ,  dad . 
i only wanted to know what she &apos;s like in the sack .  do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy ? 
a - negative .  i &apos;ve cross - matched it . 
i think i &apos;ve seen this nut somewhere .   haven &apos;t i ? 
is he out ? 
never mind the conversation .  do it ,  dad . 
i can &apos;t feel it now either .  the mother must have gone in . 
it &apos;s five minutes into nurses &apos; shower hour .  where are they ? 
might make kind of a social issue ,  not having any other negro officer . 
all of them ? 
listen ,  we look pretty lousy out there ,  right ? 
our minds ? 
and absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband .  do we have that in common ,  captain ? 
i couldn &apos;t have slept tonight anyhow . 
you please excuse .  .  .   i have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army . 
it was really nice of you to take me along . 
the real trapper john ?  the one who threw you the famous pass and went to greater glory on the boston and maine railroad ? 
what &apos;s wrong with him ? 
he &apos;s coming to . 
there &apos;s this native broad works in the laundry .  i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve noticed . 
in the direction you want to go . 
stop acting like a colonel ,  henry .  you know trapper wouldn &apos;t sock him without a good reason . 
fifteenth straight day there &apos;ve been six o &apos;clock choppers .  how long can a battle go on ? 
dammit ,  radar ,  wait till i call you !  tell major burns .  .  . 
sir ? 
can you make out what they &apos;re talking about ? 
yeah ? 
soup ?  rice ?  what are we doing ,  beginning all over again ? 
as long as there &apos;s a pile - up ,  we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest . 
oh ,  come on ,  now .  this is serious .  you &apos;re a man disgusted with all of civilization . 
yes ! 
now ,  look ,  john .  here &apos;s the speech .  it &apos;s in caps and double - spaced .  you won &apos;t have any trouble reading it .  not nervous ,  are you ? 
uh - huh .  to carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech . 
do you care if i sit down out here ? 
well ,  would you like to know who it was you were marrying ? 
hello .  whenever there &apos;s a pretty woman around ,  er  this is my nephew ,  ted sheldon ,  miss mitchell . 
oh !  oh ,  it &apos;s beautiful ,  d .  b .  welli don &apos;t quite know what to say  .   .   . 
what ? 
that &apos;s your father &apos;s diary ,  ann . 
now ,  then comes the drama .  he meets discouragement .  he finds the world has feet of clay .  his ideals crumble .  so what does he do ?   he decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization .  he thinks of the river !   but no ,  no ,  he has a better idea .  the city hall .  why ?   because he wants to attract attention .  he wants to get a few things off his chest ,  and that &apos;s the only way he can get himself heard . 
thinks it &apos;s terrific .  says for us to go the limit .  wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state . 
how many is that ,  six ?  pretty hungry ,  weren &apos;t you ? 
where &apos;d you play ? 
hey ,  do you know something ?  she supports a mother and two kids .  what do you know about that ? 
and when they get you ,  you got no more chance than a road - rabbit . 
st - rike ! 
this is sourpuss .  er ,  excuse me .  er ,  mr .  smithers ,  mr .  doe . 
well ,  anyway ,  ii guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came ,  except the delaneys .  the delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn ,  and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money ,  so why bother about inviting him ?  until grimes ,  the milkman spoke up and he said ,   &quot; say ,  you &apos;ve got the delaneys all wrong .  &quot;  and then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week ,  and how ,  when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty .   &quot; if you ask me ,  &quot;  he says ,   &quot; they &apos;re starving .  &quot; 
hey ,  stop worrying ,  colonel .  fifty bucks ain &apos;t going to ruin me . 
i gotta figure some way out of this thing ! 
jitterbugs .  &#93 9] close shot :  john and the colonel . 
join the john doe club . 
you must be wrong ,  mr .  connell ,   &apos;cause he &apos;s been marvelous about the john doe clubs . 
well ,  i don &apos;t get it . 
miss mitchell ,  do me a favor ,  will you ?  go on out and get married and have a lot o &apos; babiesbut stay out o &apos; newspaper business ! 
why ,  certainly .  with your ability to influence people ,  it might grow into a glorious movement . 
now ,  hold on a minute ,  young man !  hold on !  that &apos;s rather big talk !  i started the john doe clubs with my money and i &apos;ll decide whether or not they &apos;re being properly used ! 
listen ,  folks ,  it &apos;s a fact that i didn &apos;t write the letter ,  but this whole thing started
it &apos;s good to see you .  sit down . 
i bet you he &apos;d know how to say it all right .  and me ,  i get up to it and around it and in back of it ,  but ,  but i never get right to it .  do you know what i mean ?  so the only chance i &apos;ve got is ,  well ,  if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of ,  sorta prepare her for the shock ! 
yep .  there was a major league scout there watching me ,  too .  and he came down after the game with a contract .  do you know what ?   i couldn &apos;t life my arm to sign it .  but i &apos;ll be okay again as soon as i get it fixed up . 
what do you mean ,  too bad ? 
is there a crowd in the street ? 
then he may be caught on a ledge !  look again ! 
this swat guy might be a good idea .  he may be able to take a little pressure off you .  i worry about you . 
no shit !  he &apos;s good ! 
apartment 306 . 
nah ,  it probably won &apos;t turn up anything .  i &apos;m just gonna talk to him . 
i &apos;ve got to stop in there .  .  .  mr .  korda ,  do you know frank antonucci ? 
could i please have a little water ? 
perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this .  .  .  situation . 
not the fucking cop that showed up at my door ! 
you gotta do this for me .  i &apos;m in here because of you . 
don &apos;t make do it ,  mike . 
the old guy ?  what kind of show of faith is that ?  i want debbie .

you don &apos;t have to come here . 
are you in charge ,  roper ? 
i want a plane waiting at the airport .  i &apos;ll tell them where i want to go when i get there . 
for now that &apos;s all . 
you can &apos;t kill me like this . 
don &apos;t go reading my lips ,  man .  that &apos;s an intrusion .  save that shit for the sniper school .  comprende ? 
we &apos;re already past it ,  aren &apos;t we ,  kevin ? 
i grew up in oakland .  .  .  crossed the bay bridge and here i was .   so you &apos;re looking for  &quot; fast advancement &quot;  . 
we see each other every couple of months . 
tell me what you need . 
you could say something like ,    &quot; tell me what the scumbag &apos;s name is .  maybe we can work something out .  &quot; 
you know the ten commandments ? 
you tell me . 
to run last ? 
the 6 horse is still last . 
we won ! 
that &apos;s a chance i gotta take . 
mccall ,  you all right ? 
roper .  metro division .  hostage negotiator .  give me the short version . 
i can &apos;t leave ,  ray .  it &apos;s part of my negotiator &apos;s oath .  once i &apos;m in the room with the hostage ,  i have to stay . 
not for you ,  ray .  for me .  a close friend of mine was killed this week .  the way i figure it ,  i stop you from doin &apos; what you said ,  i &apos;m one up on body count . 
that a new picture ? 
i wanted to get this out of the way . 
that kind with the garlic and the oil that i like so much ? 
why don &apos;t you just stick your finger in and stir it up . 
scottie ,  remember the day you lost that hostage in union square .  you came over that night and we made mad ,  crazy love .  but i didn &apos;t even know what happened .  .  .   &apos;til i heard it on the news the next morning . 
there is ? 
stay here ,  don &apos;t move . 
i &apos;ve never seen sea so blue .  tahiti is magnificent ,  scottie . 
roper . 
what if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it ? 
the chief says to tell you how sorry he is .  he knew sam baffert was a good man . 
as long as it &apos;s not  &apos;what &apos;s your sign ?  &apos;
your life that bad ? 
who are you ?  ! 
it &apos;s all here .  .  . 
the guests are here . 
it &apos;s time to wake up . 
you are not a god . 
god creates man ,  man creates technology ,  technology creates god .   end into beginning . 
the new world . 
you were the one who was dying . 
with the energy from the net ,  we can program this world anyway we want .   redwood forests .   oceans .  mountains  -  - 
until you &apos;re on the net where the corporation can &apos;t touch you ,  you can &apos;t open the system .   they &apos;ll eject it if you do . 
remember ,  i &apos;m not the one who chose this . 
where you plugged - in from ? 
what &apos;s her name ? 
get some internal police there .  tell them to run a perimeter . 
doesn &apos;t make sense .   how the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys ? 
we can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system . 
one condition . 
a hotel ? 
christoph was in charge of designing building modules . 
there was no need to kill her . 
care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program ? 
why not ? 
don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . 
voice activate . 
connection approved .   ready to transmit  -  - 
standard ,  modern ,  upscale  -  - 
we &apos;ve got him locked ! 
he &apos;s on us !  ! 
we can &apos;t break free ! 
it &apos;s far too dangerous .   zordon would never allow it . 
wow .   sand . 
alpha ,  my sensors tell me the rangers were too late !   ivan is on his way here ! 
 .  .  .  alpha ,  i am deeply concerned about the rangers .  .  . 
by bouncing ultra - high frequencies off one of the network satellites ,  i can send a long - range pulsar signal to within two feet of the rangers coordinates . 
i see .  .  .  a fox
and how do we do that ? 
but boss ,  what about their parents ? 
simon says .  .  . 
don &apos;t you ever have anything nice to say ?  ! 
isn &apos;t this just typical !   we finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens ! 
three seconds !  ! 
what you &apos;re sayin &apos; makes a lotta sense .  ya know ,  if i keep on killin &apos; people like i have ,  i won &apos;t have no more friends left ! 
are you frightened ? 
up down .  down up .  it &apos;s the same .  you see things through both eyes . 
what do you mean ? 
when the stiff &apos;s an irish ,  the cops take it kinda personal . 
they told me you wanted to talk about this shane business . 
but maranzano &apos;s got the men and the brains . 
i think maranzano &apos;s talkin &apos; a hell of a deal . 
does maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you &apos;ll take his goddamn money ? 
no .  they envy you . 
a lot of shit came out of me in the hospital .  i &apos;m sorry you got hit by it . 
would it be painful for you ? 
i &apos;m gonna lose you ,  charlie . 
charlie ,  i &apos;m from the old country ,  and these american ways get me sometimes confused .  you tellin &apos; us you refuse the title of boss of all the bosses ? 
we can get the war started tomorrow ,  but it won &apos;t be pretty . 
i &apos;m glad ya come . 
this business is about taking risks . 
boss ,  i got all the time you need . 
if i wanted ta kill ya ,  i woulda done it long ago .  it &apos;s not like you ain &apos;t given me reason . 
what are ya thinkin &apos; ? 
you can &apos;t fuck with them .  they &apos;re heads of families ! 
we gotta talk in private .  i got a friend in coney island who &apos;s gonna open his restaurant just for us . 
ya did good .  i ain &apos;t seen the boss so happy in weeks . 
when ya got all that blood workin &apos; in your belly ,  it ain &apos;t upstairs where it needs to be . 
and how many soldiers do you have ? 
i have six hundred .  soldiers .  and more every week off the boat . 
the internal revenue came to my offices .  i turned over all my ledgers .  they found nothing .  charlie ,  i am a businessman . 
tell me ,  my son .  why did you go with giuseppe ?  he &apos;s not our kind . 
we learn from life . 
if you give him the chance ,  lansky will betray you like judas . 
at first ,  it will hurt you .  but you will come to understand and we will be strong together . 
even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns . 
tell it to the calabrian .  tell it to the jews . 
forget it .  that &apos;s past . 
thank you for keeping me informed . 
bring order out of chaos .  if you lead .  .  .  they &apos;ll follow . 
johnson &apos;s still on board .  even maranzano won &apos;t screw with nucky in atlantic city .  but everywhere else ,  we got nothing but problems . 
i &apos;m a hard guy .  i done more jobs than alla you combined .  and i never said no .  not once .  but dammit i don &apos;t understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends ! 
what a cozy little scene . 
jeez ,  bugsy .  ya like ta scared the crap outta me . 
best we got . 
you &apos;re fuckin &apos; crazy . 
yeah ,  i know  -  picasso .  guernica< / u> ,  right ?  that &apos;s what everybody says  -  although personally ,  i don &apos;t see the resemblance .  what are you drinking ? 
i was ,  uh ,  just getting ready to leave .  .  . 
de nada< / i> .  now ,  come here .  .  . bend over .  .  . before i change my mind . 
what &apos;s the matter ? 
well ,  nothing .  it &apos;s a benefit .  but we could probably get people< / u> and entertainment tonight< / u> to cover it . 
it &apos;s a special kind of party .  a farewell< / u> party .  do you .  .  . get what i &apos;m saying ? 
meaning me ,  of course .  i &apos;m referring to myself .  you have to assume monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise .  .  . 
and speaking of which ,  here &apos;s the light of my life ,  the pert and saucy miss julie mcelroy . 
you &apos;re wearing a topcoat< / u> ,  stu .   -  where are your pants ? 
it is new .  why wouldn &apos;t it be new ? 
oh ,  stu .  tell me i &apos;m not dreaming . 
hypnos ? 
don &apos;t ask where i got it . 
you< / u> have humiliated me in public for the last< / u> time< / u> . 
he &apos;s ninety .  he &apos;s practically dead already .  how come he< / u> goes back and i< / u> stay here ? 
he &apos;s taking her to the land of death ,  right ?  so all we &apos;ve gotta do is .  .  . hitch a ride !  < / i> stop shaking !  i &apos;ll protect you . 
you saved my life ,  monkeybone .  i never would &apos;ve made it without you . 
it &apos;s just .  .  . now that i &apos;m leaving ,  i feel like there &apos;s lots of things i haven &apos;t said .  who &apos;s gonna look out for you ?  are you gonna be okay when i &apos;m gone ? 
dating anyone ? 
where to ? 
uh ,  yes .   my husband passed away recently  .  .  . 
i &apos;ll take your hat into the cloak room . 
and you say you never signed this contract with mr .  allen ? 
then -  - this is *not* you signature ,  senator ? 
you are saying ,  in effect ,  that this is a forgery ? 
and while you &apos;re at it ,  get me a bed ! 
sure .  sure .  i &apos;ll hang a light in the steeple .  one if by land -  - two if by sea !  .  .  .  okay !   diz -  - you won &apos;t believe it .  daniel boone &apos;s *lost* ! 
no ,  not yet ,  senator paine -  - not hide nor hair of the man .  you mean to say the boys haven &apos;t -  -  ? 
diz ,  you &apos;re a swell playmate -  - but -  -  .  maybe if i saw you once with your hair combed ,  or something -  - or -  - no ,  no -  - i don &apos;t think even that would do it -  - 
that gorilla in man &apos;s clothing -  -  mcgann . 
you play -  - left field . 
why do i always laugh at that ? 
now ,  you &apos;ve gone and let don quixote in here again .  i told you to keep him out ! 
well -  - cut it out .  see ?  who *cares* anyway ? 
*all right* ,  then .  after all ,  what &apos;s it to me ?  so they *drop* him out of a balloon .  all i care is -  - i don &apos;t want to be around .  see ?  squeamish .  see ?  that &apos;s what i am .  no ,  sir .  i don &apos;t have to take it .  won &apos;t be a party to no murder .  i &apos;m gonna quit .  i &apos;m through . 
diz -  - 
no . 
no !  i can &apos;t think of anything more sappy ! )
i won &apos;t take it !  see ?  i won &apos;t be party to murder .  see ?  steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting taylor mob is low enough .  but helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides -  - nobody &apos;s gonna make me do that .  no ,  sir . 
what ! 
yes ,  joe ,  yes -  - right away .  
nonsense .  why don &apos;t you listen to your children for a change ?  you might actually learn something ? 
emma !  i &apos;m a man at the end of his rope . 
are you ready for him ,  bill ? 
good .  are the newspaper men at the hotel ? 
oh -  - oh . 
one minute !  just one minute ! 
they put up *their* candidate ?  who ? 
i said forget  &apos;em !  horace miller goes to the senate -  - and that settles it ! 
yes !  he &apos;s about to blow the whole machine to smithereens -  - and *you with it* ,  mr .  governor ! 
now -  - now -  - please -  - that &apos;s quite all right .  relax ,  boys -  - 
no .  no .  a signal service to the state .  yes ,  indeed .  and not only that but -  -  uh -  - i &apos;ve heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth -  - 
thanks ,  governor -  - *yes* !  do you mind ?  his head -  - ma &apos;ll take the tail . 
maybe you &apos;d like to come along and watch ,  governor ?  jefferson &apos;s done a wonderful job with that leg . 
well ,  he &apos;s still running the show ,  ain &apos;t he ,  dad ? 
where were you ? 
mr .  president ! 
well ,  it isn &apos;t much ,  but if you insist ,  here &apos;s this week &apos;s .  
but -  - there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water .  besides -  - i talked to kenneth allen ,  who owns some of that land -  - and he didn &apos;t say anything about a dam .  no -  -  i &apos;m sure ,  sir -  - there &apos;s something wrong -  - and i -  - i won &apos;t vote on this thing until i get a lot of questions answered -  - 
i have no defense against forged papers and -  - 
mr .  president !  a point of order ! 
please ,  sir !  -  - come with me ! 
hello ,  jefferson . 
but you have some objections here and there .  and maybe right ,  for all i know .  but the point is -  - there &apos;s no sense stopping the whole works now -  -  specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through -  - 
go out to mount vernon .  it &apos;d be a sort of fine thing to do -  - see washington &apos;s home just before walking into the senate for the first time -  -  don &apos;t you think ? 
no ,  gee -  - i couldn &apos;t stay here -  - 
my dear senator ,  have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a bill passed ? 
fine .  now ,  what does he do ?  he &apos;s got to sit down first and write it up .  the where ,  when ,  why ,  how -  - and everything else .  that takes time -  - 
a *day* ! 
that &apos;s the order of business .  your bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the steering committee decides it is important enough to be -  - 
pardon ? 
 -  - that &apos;s the main idea ,  miss saunders .  the united states government isn &apos;t going to buy or build this camp -  -  just lend us the money .  you &apos;ve made a note of that ,  huh ? 
we need a lot like him -  - his kind of character -  - ideals . 
i take it your -  - your parents couldn &apos;t -  -  uh -  - 
i &apos;ve got more .  you better tell me . 
get your hat ,  senator .  we &apos;ve got a lot to do between now and tomorrow -  - 
and you &apos;re writing ma all about it .  and your pigeons will carry the message of love .  and the first thing you know -  - susan paine &apos;ll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted ! 
no .  that night -  - i -  - well ,  *you* know -  -  i was pretty -  -  .  no -  - diz is a -  - a sort of brother ,  that &apos;s all -  - 
well ,  i guess it &apos;s a chance . 
where do we go from here ? 
fine -  - they &apos;re fine .   oh ,  miss paine ,  i -  - i want to apologize -  -  what the papers said i said about you -  - that wasn &apos;t true .  i -  - i would never say a thing like that . 
i -  - i &apos;m awfully glad to be -  - that is ,  it was nice of you to -  -   uh -  - how &apos;s your father ? 
uh -  - that &apos;s good .  and -  - uh -  - you ? 
the senator understands he is limited to five minutes ? 
order ,  gentlemen ! 
one moment ,  friends ,  let &apos;s give the senator a break .   now ,  where &apos;d you say you studied law ? 
ax ? 
well !  hear anything ?  any sign of him ? 
what !  who ? 
i wouldn &apos;t wait if i were you . 
here ,  jeff ,  i &apos;ll advance it for you .  -  -  fine introduction to the nation &apos;s capital ! 
 -  - amazing coincidence !  of all places in the world -  - to choose willet creek for his boys &apos; camp ! 
that won &apos;t work ,  chick .  this boy &apos;s honest ,  not stupid . 
look ,  nosey -  - your pals would like to get in on this ,  wouldn &apos;t they ? 
no -  - i &apos;m sorry .  i merely saw him home .  i &apos;m not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle .  that &apos;s mcgann &apos;s job . 
yes .  he went to mount vernon to give himself a patriotic address . 
what are you driving at ?  you want *me* to get him to sign that ? 
what are you talking about ?  what difference -  -  ? 
that &apos;s why i say miller -  - horace miller .  he jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench .  he &apos;ll take orders . 
joe ,  that &apos;s coming a long way in twenty years since i met you practising law down there in main street . 
his first  &apos;whiff &apos; ! 
he sure is pixilated . 
why ,  you own it ,  longfellow . 
any children ? 
all right ,  mr .  dodsworth .  i think you &apos;ll qualify .   take this to that desk over there for further instructions . 
were you present when all these things took place ? 
but they did take place ? 
oh ,  thank you ! 
tell me more about yourself . 
have you seen the papers ? 
there you are .  grant &apos;s tomb .  i hope you &apos;re not disappointed . 
now ,  what do you see ? 
there &apos;s times square . 
you &apos;re worried about those articles they &apos;re writing about you ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
what did you mean by that ? 
the drums .  he taught me to play some . 
the reason why i wanted to take a walk ,  mary ,  is  &apos;cause i wanted to talk to you . 
would you like to read it ?  it &apos;s to you . 
you haven &apos;t gotten very far ,  have you ?  that &apos;s where you were an hour ago .  come on ,  let &apos;s knock off and go down to joe &apos;s .  the gang &apos;s waiting for us . 
good night . 
you started out to be a successful newspaper woman ,  didn &apos;t you ? 
you &apos;re acting like a school girl . 
look ,  i can do it ! 
what &apos;s bothering you ,  huh ? 
proposed to you !  you mean he asked you to marry him ? 
i suppose it &apos;s going to be the same old thing . 
the gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room ,  sir .  they &apos;re getting a trifle impatient ,  sir . 
is that the best you &apos;ve got ? 
stuff ,  sir ? 
he &apos;s not home ,  i tell you ! 
he &apos;s what ? 
i can &apos;t find him . 
yes ? 
perhaps you didn &apos;t hear what i said ,  mr .  deeds !  the whole semple fortune goes to you !  $20 , 000 , 000 ! 
are you a married man ,  mr .  deeds ? 
no ? 
yes .  that is to say
i mean ,  about the power of attorney . 
have a drink ? 
gee ,  i &apos;m busy .  did the opera people always come here for their meetings ? 
well ,  how about tonight ?  what would you like in the way of entertainment ? 
did you see all this stuff in the papers ? 
what about your knocking off for lunch ? 
now ,  where were we ? 
it reminds me very much of this one .  nicht wahr ? 
yeah  -  that &apos;s all that &apos;s worrying you .  what do i want ?   a chance to feed a wife and kids !  i &apos;m a farmer .  a job !  that &apos;s what i want ! 
here &apos;s the order for the plows .  we got a good price on them . 
my wife wanted me to tell you she  she prays for you every night . 
common - law wife .  on top of that ,  there &apos;s a child . 
yes ,  sir . 
mrs .  semple is entitled by law to one - third of the estate . 
no  -  i don &apos;t want it ,  thank you . 
huh ?  on ,  no .  nobody important . 
brookfield just came in . 
say fellow ,  you neglected me  -  and i feel very put out .   look ,  sock it right there ,  will you ?  lay one right on the button ,  &#93 6] but sock it hard . 
that ought to be fun . 
who are they ? 
no ,  sir . 
but she isn &apos;t due for an hour ,  sir . 
shall i call the police ,  sir ? 
why are they ganging up against me ? 
i had ordered some books .   &quot; the 100 greatest books ever written .  &quot; 
you can go out there if you like .  .  . 
that &apos;s it  -  -  syndrome .  so you know all about it ? 
better make yourself comfortable .  we got a three hour drive here . 
what an asshole ! 
thank you . 
dr .  delbanco .  it &apos;s nice to see you again . 
i &apos;ve run on .  forgive me .  we &apos;re here to talk about you . 
i see . 
why not ? 
well ,  i don &apos;t know .  .  .  i only been seeing you  -  - 
now hold on ,  i didn &apos;t say i didn &apos;t want to come  -  - 
i enjoy it .  does that make me some kind of pervert ?  just because a man has a rich imaginative life  -  - 
 -  -  and you told me that .  still ,  there &apos;s some kind of imagery that &apos;s haunting you and ,  i think ,  getting in your way  -  - 
whoa ,  whoa ,  what are you doing ?  i want to know what &apos;s in here . 
i feel like we &apos;re making real progress here . 
clarence norman white ,  do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged ? 
 .  .  . people who have come to you with the faith that you know what you &apos;re doing .  .  .  and that you are who you say you are ? 
mr .  white ,  i am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000 . 
that &apos;s a lot of people all at once . 
meat loaf ,  turkey quesadillas ,  or salad nicoise . 
how long you been in this town ? 
four months ,  two and a half weeks  -  -  that &apos;s how long .   and you &apos;ve already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined . 
and the brocketts ? 
hello ,  lionel . 
it &apos;s a country club .  don &apos;t worry about it . 
hello ,  mother .  i want you to meet dr .  mumford . 
just who is here ,  can you tell me ? 
when did you start to feel this way ? 
we don &apos;t discuss it . 
and i &apos;ll bet you can interpret the whole thing
is that when you split up ? 
i &apos;m saying that since i &apos;m doing so much better  -  -  which i attribute to you  -  -  i &apos;m liable to misinterpret some of my feelings . 
i guess you saw the show .  .  .  ? 
 .  .  . how violated i feel ? 
you feel violated ? 
we &apos;re only talking about six weeks . 
pro boner ?   pro bono ,  huh ?  for whose good ,  supposedly ? 
fuck the community .   there was this article my friends and i read .  it was  &quot; 25 signs he &apos;s great in bed &quot;  .  it was very fascinating . 
i knew you wouldn &apos;t answer .  i &apos;ve been thinking about what you said last time .  how me trying to lose weight  -  -  and constantly not  -  -  is like a lot of people with addictions .  how maybe i can &apos;t lose the weight ,  ever .  .  .   which we already knew .  .  . 
would you like another beer ? 
i gotta pee .   can i ask you something ?  this town is called mumford .  .  .  been that way since .  .  .  18 .  .  .  18 - 0 .  .  .  18 - 0 .  .  .    .  .  . thirteen !  right ?   now here &apos;s the question  -  -  your name is mumford ,  too . 
skip ,  you &apos;re the head of the whole deal here .  are they busier than you ? 
so i guess henry follett is a patient of yours .  he &apos;s my pharmacist . 
you &apos;re a shrink ,  doc .  aren &apos;t i supposed to be able to tell you everything ? 
a doll ? 
an irs investigator with a drug problem ? 
at least you pulled yourself out .  .  . 
i wish i could live in the shower .  i &apos;d take five a day if i had the time .  i went to this spa in germany ,  a sanitarium practically ,  up on this mountain .  and the great thing  -  -  they just kept you wet all day . 
sorry .  .  . 
forgive me ,  please .  what a gracious thought .  we must do that . 
it &apos;s possible .  i don &apos;t know about that . 
no mortal weapons can kill this creature .  he is not of this world . 
who the hell are these guys ? 
we saved him !  saved him before the creature could finish his work .  now leave ,  all of you ,  quickly ,  before he finishes you all . 
and how does one do that ? 
oh yes ,  of course . 
my very good friend !  what a surprise . 
like what that moses guy did to that pharaoh guy ? 
i &apos;m sorry ,  it was an accident . 
i &apos;m thinking that if the black book of the dead can bring people back to life  -  - 
okay ,  let &apos;s cut to the chase .  he &apos;s afraid of cats ,  what &apos;s that about ? 
the hell with this .  i &apos;m goin ,  downstairs to get me a drink .  you want somethin &apos; ? 
a bright good morning to all . 
you were actually at hamunaptra ? 
give .  .  .  give him .  .  .  give him glaaaa -  -   ! 
you know your history . 
relax !  i &apos;m the map !   it &apos;s all up here . 
why would i do that ? 
is he supposed to look like that ? 
are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy ,  and they slowly ate him alive ? 
yes ,  they never used it because they feared it so .  it &apos;s written ,  that if a victim of the hom - dai should ever arise ,  he would bring with him the ten plagues of egypt . 
got guts ,  lady . 
yes .  the city of the dead .  where the early pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of egypt . 
i can &apos;t believe i allowed the two of you to get me drunk . 
juicy ? 
sit down ,  o &apos;connell ,  sit down ,  we could use another good player . 
where &apos;s my gun ? 
did you see that !  ?  grasshoppers !  billions of grasshoppers ! 
damn - it !  that &apos;s two down and only two to go . 
what are you doing all alone in the dark ? 
and then one day ,  he didn &apos;t come home .  the police said it was an accident .  but cargo containers don &apos;t just fall on people .  he was murdered .  .  .  after that i fell apart .  i dropped out of school ,  became a mud wrestler ,  married and divorced a jerk .  when my mother died i hit bottom .  .  .  but then ,  when i was cleaning out her attic ,  i found my father &apos;s old bowling bag and costume ,  almost like he &apos;d left them there for me .  .  .  and i knew what i had to do . 
but she &apos;s your mother .  you gotta tell her . 
i &apos;m her only son ,  and she always had such high hopes for me .  medicine .  law . 
casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him .  .  .  and there wasn &apos;t a thing that we could do about it . 
yes ! 
that boy &apos;s got talent . 
hi . 
most people just want to make money or be famous or something .  but you risk everything ,  just to help people . 
roy .  .  .  we might never see each other again ,  so i &apos;d better tell you now .  .  .  i think you &apos;re wonderful . 
your rage is a very great power ,  but it blinds you to your heart . 
oh don &apos;t start that again  -  - 
and it would be the right thing to do . 
have you ever seen him ? 
you sure that &apos;s how you spell it ? 
you know something ?  those guys are really starting to piss me off ! 
get mad ! 
so why don &apos;t you just tell her ! 
maybe you should try a more romantic approach . 
i saw him go in  -  -  and he didn &apos;t come out ! 
the who ? 
roy ,  remember ,  it is all within your power .  the only thing that &apos;s in your way .  .  .  is you . 
he &apos;s turned into a completely normal person ! 
so you &apos;re only invisible .  .  .  to yourself ? 
the obliterators ! 
firepower costs money . 
i use it .  .  .  to fight evil . 
this is bad . 
and a social life . 
to us ! 
we &apos;ve got lift off ! 
it is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy ,  that one government should assume a right to dictate to another ,  who is upon terms of equality ,  the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and ,  assuming such a right ,  second it by threatening language ,  in case of non - compliance . 
my dear caulaincourt ,  agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live .   napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure england but ,  before that ,  he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live .   he cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring england to her knees  -  -  and i &apos;m afraid that is what it has come to . 
your majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine ,  and goes far beyond my official role as ambassador .   but i would be remiss in my feelings for you ,  and in my responsibility to the emperor ,  if i did not say that it is entirely possible that the emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the treaty of tilsit ,  as the first step in the exchange of a french alliance for an english one  -  -  with all the dangers that might entail . 
the point i was trying to make is that i think it is reasonable to say that your majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure ,  if he decided to make peace with the emperor ,  at least at this time . 
without a doubt ,  to estimate the enemy &apos;s strength on the battlefield .  this is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct .  at jena ,  there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present .   murat said there were 50 , 000 ,  preparing to attack .   berthier said there were no more than 25 , 000 ,  about to withdraw .   &quot; berthier sees only what is in the open ,  &quot;  murat said .    &quot; but don &apos;t forget there is a second force hidden in the forest .  &quot;   and so it would always go ,  each of them would judge things according to his own ability ,  character and state of mind ,  at the moment . 
i don &apos;t even know whether a defense is possible . 
these are odds of 8 to 1 . 
but where are my wife and son ?  what &apos;s become of them ?   where is marmont ?   where is mortier ? 
but ,  sire ,  your majesty would lay paris open to being sacked .   the enemy is outside the gates with more than 120 , 000 men .   besides this ,  i left the city under the terms of a treaty and i am forbidden to reenter paris . 
was the trip normal in every respect ? 
then ,  you have my thanks ,  captain charles ,  for safely escorting madame bonaparte to milan ,  and you may consider your assignment completed . 
when did it start ? 
i told mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting . 
good heavens ,  ambassador  -  -  what has happened ? 
i beg your indulgence ,  ambassador ,  but it is . 
the emperor has decided to marry your archduchess ,  marie - louise . 
earlier this afternoon ,  the emperor refused the hand of the grand duchess anna ,  of russia ,  and ,  as i &apos;m sure you can appreciate ,  he is quite able to change his mind again .   for the emperor ,  to choose a wife ,  is only a matter of minutes . 
oh .  .  .  ? 
thank you . 
oh ,  i see .  .  .  that must be a great burden . 
no .  .  .  i have a .  .  .  room .  .  .  at the hotel de perrin . 
i know of no better time . 
it is time to clarify the situation .  everything is over between us . 
ah ,  my dear madame de montesquiou ,  you have no idea what happiness it brings me to see this child ,  at last .   i was told the very idea of such a visit would too much distress the empress . 
oh .  .  .  i see .   i understand .   how is .  .  .  the emperor ? 
ah ,  how nice to meet you ,  general bonaparte .   one has read so much about you lately .   please sit down . 
promise me . 
perhaps  -  -  but tell me you promise ,  anyway . 
but you will not .  .  .  be safe .  .  . 
who is it ? 
i believe you sent for me . 
well ,  anyway ,  sorry to call you away from the festivities ,  but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles ?   i asked for it yesterday . 
well ,  he didn &apos;t give it to me ,  and when i ask you to do something for me ,  return the work to me ,  not to berthier . 
yes . 
how do you know ? 
may i inform you ,  monsieur ,  that i am major fidon ,  official courier to the court of the emperor napoleon ,  on my way to our embassy at st .  petersburg and ,  in accordance with the rules of the road ,  no one may overtake or pass me . 
will it be possible to have my dog ,  bijou ,  sent here ?   i was not allowed to bring her and i love her so much . 
i hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is ,  sire .  my impression of alexander is that he is moody and impressionable ,  capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments .   he is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity .   you have dazzled him ,  and you have performed a diplomatic miracle ,  but alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear . 
then do you propose to arrest all of us ,  citizen lieutenant ?   for i was not there alone . 
napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the directory in paris ,  exceeding his authority ,  making political decisions and treaties like a roman conqueror ,  enlarging his role to ruler of italy .   only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the directory from replacing him . 
yeah ,  you gotta have a little money to live out here ,  craig .   i never thought i &apos;d be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs .   but as soon as i got my check ,  i was gone .   paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house . 
i don &apos;t know ,  i think i passed out or something .   i don &apos;t remember . 
we didn &apos;t come here for day - day . 
where you going ? 
great moves ,  day - day . 
yeah it is .  .  . the best day before the weekend . 
what &apos;s the green stuff poking out ? 
man ,  day - day is my people !

alright ,  roach ,  see you around . 
i hope to god that dog is happy .

you want us to give you a ride ? 
i &apos;m sorry for what my brother did this morning .   they &apos;re assholes . 
thanks for noticing .   it used ta be peaceful before they got out .   took over the house and caused my mother &apos;s nervous breakdown . 
easier said than done .   we saved up to get away from them ,  but they followed us . 
i &apos;ll be out in about 35 - 40 minutes ! 
18 - years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing .   i still can &apos;t figure that one out . 
craig ,  remember what i told you . 
what kind of activity ? 
i can &apos;t get jiggy with this shit .   where is the damn manager ? 
no ,  give me my damn money back .   right now ,  and i don &apos;t have no damn receipt neither . 
that the big one ,  huh ? 
what was that ? 
yoooo ,  that &apos;s it .   you ain &apos;t as dumb as i think you are ,  roach . 
try an &apos; hold it ,  man .   squeeze your ass cheeks together . 
finally you got a bitch ,  huh ,  roach ? 
ah damn .   damn . 
why would he take it ?   he don &apos;t even know you . 
what you say ? 
when ?   after you get all drunk and loaded ? 
what about that ugly dog ? 
huh ? 
mr .  nasty time ? 
lousy .  and i have siesta hair .  i &apos;m thinking of canceling the speech . 
during a campaign every speech is important .  this is free media exposure .  primetime news coverage that we couldn &apos;t buy . 
truth is ,  besides the headache i &apos;ve come down with a little lower intestinal havoc .  make my apologies . 
i have a problem . 
i remember you .  .  . in the elevator . 
you were very nervous . 
how do you know that ?

hey ,  would you look at this crazy car ?  everybody has their own radio .  what do you think of that ? 
i &apos;m not a baby . 
close your eyes . 
look at  &apos;em .  he &apos;d do anything for her .  -

an evening gown . 
that &apos;s her .

it &apos;s midnight .  one half of paris is making love to the other half .  look at the clock .  one hand has met the other hand .  they kiss .  isn &apos;t that wonderful ? 
oh ,  let it ring . 
i didn &apos;t follow you . 
oh ,  ninotchka ,  who wants to talk business .  if you win the suit ,  fine .  if we win the suit ,  better .  you do me an injustice .   when we went to my apartment did i have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal ? 
just smile . 
i have never heard one . 
i wish they had never met . 
i don &apos;t look too foolish ? 
you see i couldn &apos;t shout that . 
from what i read i thought champagne was a strong drink .  it &apos;s very delicate .  do people ever get drunk on this ? 
quickly ,  please .  .  .  tell me one of your funny stories . 
now ,  ninotchka .  .  .  please ! 
don &apos;t tell them where we &apos;re going ,  sweetheart . 
and we won &apos;t stretch up our arms .  .  . 
czar peter gave it to his wife ,  catherine the great .  for it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market . 
those newspaper people ? 
is anything wrong ?  are you ill ? 
you saw all that in one glimpse ? 
hello ,  leon darling ! 
now ,  please ,  swana . 
my lawyer agrees with you .  he says france will uphold it in every court ,  but i will drag you through every court ,  don &apos;t forget that .  and when i say it will take two years i am ,  as always ,  conservative . 
i am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five - forty plane to moscow . 
i haven &apos;t either ,  but i &apos;ve heard about them .  you must realize it was only on the strength of your paris report that i sent them to constantinople; without that i never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal . 
how can i make myself clear .  .  .  it is difficult to express but i &apos;d rather not go to foreign countries any more .  please ,  comrade .  .  .  let me stay here .  .  .  let me finish my work .  .  .  i am in the rhythm of it now .  .  .  i don &apos;t want to go away .  i don &apos;t want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again .  it throws one out of gear .  .  .  .  let me finish my work .  .  .  i have concentrated everything in it .  .  .  please .  .  .  don &apos;t make me go . 
bring me something simple .  i never think about food . 
your highness ,  forgive this intrusion ,  but .  .  . 
no ,  madame ,  something of the utmost importance .  .  .  it concerns your jewels . 
uh ,  he &apos;s rushing back from his tennis game ,  sir  .  .  . 
the bigger problem i see is this guy who was arrested ,  mccord  -  -  james mccord  -  -  he headed up security for the committee to re - elect .   he turns out to be ex - cia . 
sir ,  i still don &apos;t think ,  uh ,  we can contain it anymore .   there &apos;s a cancer on the presidency .   and it &apos;s growing .  with every day that  .  .  . 
i &apos;m not going to be the scapegoat for this .   haldeman and ehrlichman are in just as deep as me . 
how the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the president of the united states ? 
it was her wrist .   and it was through a plate - glass door . 
eight words back in  &apos;72  -  -   &quot; i covered up .   i was wrong .   i &apos;m sorry &quot;   -  -  and the american public would &apos;ve forgiven him .   but we never opened our mouths ,  john .   we failed him . 
i don &apos;t have time for all this shit !   just handle it ,  bob !   keep it out of the white house .   what else ?  kissinger &apos;s waiting  -  -  he &apos;s gonna throw a tantrum again if i don &apos;t see him ,  threatening to quit  .  .  .  again .  
hunt ?   howard hunt ? 
where &apos;s hunt now ? 
excuse me  .  .  .  are you talking about recognizing china ,  mr .  president ?  that would cost us our strongest support . 
i would personally enjoy doing that ,  sir . 
exactly !   we &apos;ve got to take the war to them .   hit  &apos;em where it hurts  -  -  right in the nuts .   more assassinations ,  more killings .   right ,  al ? 
who the fuck does cox think he is ?   i never made a dime from public office !   i &apos;m honest .   my dad died broke .   you know the sonofabitch went to law school with jack kennedy ?   .  .  .  the last gasp of the establishment !  they got the hell kicked out of  &apos;em in the election ,  so now they gotta squeal about watergate  &apos;cause we were the first real threat to them in years .  and by god ,  al ,  we would have changed it ,  changed it so they couldn &apos;t have changed it back in a hundred years ,  if only  .  .  . 
richardson won &apos;t do that .   he &apos;ll resign . 
 &quot; victory at sea ,  &quot;  al  .  .  .  henry .   the pacific theatre .   christ ,  you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks . 
june twenty - third ,   &apos;72 ,  sir .   the part that &apos;s underlined .   your instructions to haldeman regarding the cia and the fbi . 
your lawyers feel it &apos;s the  .  .  .   &quot; smoking gun .  &quot; 
if you resign ,  you can keep your tapes as a private citizen  .  .  .  you can fight them for years . 
their fourth ! 
on the list of horribles ,  i know what he is .   and i know what he tracks back to .   you say he was involved in the plumbers ? 
it &apos;s got nothing to do with justice .  it &apos;s national security . 
alright .   but why ,  if kennedy is so clean in all this ,  didn &apos;t he cancel track 2 ? 
 .  .  .  he &apos;d just found out about track 2 . 
mr .  president ! 
we really must go ,  mr .  president . 
congratulations ,  boss .   a great victory !   the madman theory wasn &apos;t so crazy after all . 
so that explains his press notices .  working both sides of the fence :  jewboy henry ,  always trying to get his nobel prize ,  get laid  .  .  . 
you know why they &apos;re turning on me ?  they &apos;re not serious about power ,  that &apos;s why .   they &apos;re playing with power .   they &apos;re forgetting the national interest .   in the old days ,  people knew how to hold power ,  how to set limits .   they wouldn &apos;t have torn this country apart over a third - rate burglary .  all they care about now are their egos ,  looking good at cocktail parties  .  .  . 
we &apos;ve got to turn the faucet off on this thing .   it &apos;s out of control  .  .  .   you might burden just me with this in the future . 
i see  .  .  .  well then ,  richard ,  we have nothing more to talk about ,  do we ? 
so am i .   thy father will have to know of thy lying . 
what &apos;d he say ? 
of course we &apos;ve tried ,  but so far we &apos;ve come up with nothing that  .  .  . 
i &apos;m sure you realize this is a very tricky area ,  mr .  president ,  given our charter and the congressional oversight committees  .  .  . 
diem ?   trujillo ?   lumumba ?   guatemala ?  cuba ?   .  .  .  it &apos;s a shame you didn &apos;t take similar precautions ,  dick . 
not if i give you all the cards  .  .  . 
and me ?   .  .  . 
not if you have spies in the white house ,  it isn &apos;t your job . 
this is an extremely dangerous direction ,  mr .  president .   terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement . 
by offering cuba to the russians as a consolation prize ? 
no . 
 .  .  .  little bobby . 
or he &apos;ll steal it like his brother .  he &apos;s a mean little sonofabitch ,  edgar  .  .  .  he had the irs audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home . 
yeah ,  well ,  as i said ,  edgar  .  .  . 
who do you think is behind it ? 
how the fuck did you know ? 
you &apos;re fucking me . 
who we working for ? 
like you said jack ,  i &apos;m just a new york lawyer now . 
so ,  what &apos;s this about ,  dick ? 
 .  .  .  and now i have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway  &apos;cross town to go to school with some nigger kids .  i think ,  mr .  president ,  you &apos;re forgetting who put you where you are . 
mr .  nixon ,  it is possible for even a president to go too far . 
yes ,  you always had a good sense of timing ,  henry .   when to give and when to take .  how do you think mao ,  brezhnev will react ?   do you think this is how they &apos;ll remember me ,  henry ,  after all the great things you and i did together ?  as some kind of  .  .  .  of  .  .  .  crooks ? 
you have many friends  .  .  .  and admirers  .  .  . 
 .  .  .  uh ,  i hope this doesn &apos;t embarrass you . 
he was a politician . 
you &apos;re too modest ,  nixon .   you &apos;re as evil as i am .   we &apos;re both from poor families .   but others pay to feed the hunger in us .   in my case ,  millions of reactionaries .   in your case ,  millions of vietnamese . 
how about kissinger along with him ? 
we can prosecute the new york times ,  go for an injunction  .  .  . 
it &apos;s a thing she does .   she talks at night . 
rocky &apos;s full of shit !   no way he &apos;s going to get nominated west of the hudson with a new wife .   he &apos;s gonna be drinking scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the republicans . 
uh ,  wait  .  .  . 
get off that .   that leads nowhere .  you should offer condolences to the families of those kids . 
where you from ? 
of them . 
we don &apos;t have to put ourselves through this again ,  dick . 
it would ruin us ,  buddy ,  our family . 
this .   above all . 
he looked old ,  didn &apos;t he ? 
hi ,  buddy .   what are you doing in here ? 
yes ! 
i &apos;m the only left ,  dick .   if you don &apos;t talk to me ,  you  .  .  . 
oh ,  happy !   dick nixon  .  .  .  you remember him . 
you heard it ? 
what would you a done if he &apos;d been released ? 
signs and wonders .  but i think once you stop hearin &apos; sir and madam the rest is soon to follow . 
 .  .  . i don &apos;t know what i do feel like . 
well what would you call him . 
hard to believe . 
he won &apos;t neither .  he never has . 
yes ma &apos;am ? 
that &apos;s the boy . 
yes ,  appears to have been a glitch or two . 
yes noreen you better had .  thank you . 
i &apos;ll call loretta when i get there .  i &apos;d call now but she &apos;ll want me to come home and i just might . 
 .  .  . i love you more &apos;n more ,  ever day . 
 .  .  . be careful . 
 .  .  . how &apos;d you sleep ? 
well you got time for  &apos;em now .  anything interesting ? 
no . 
 .  .  . if i don &apos;t come back tell mother i love her . 
not we ,  you .  stay with your mother .

sorry you had to see that .  you were saying ? 
hey ,  sheriff .  how &apos;s everything ? 
you should get the order you want . 
okay ,  let &apos;s go .  .  .  i got nothing for the record yet . 
jesus .  .  . 
bad idea .  .  . 
so ?   .  .  . suppose betty found out about them ? 
a woman can write a check . 
yeah ?  well ,  she called sue ann yesterday from arizona . 
well ,  do something ,  then ,  damnit ! 
oww .  .  .  did you have to make these things so tight ? 
just shut up a second and listen .  .  .  that ,  uh .  .  .  that bar in arizona ?  where you said betty was ? 
you wanna see if he has more shells ,  go ahead .  i say we wait .  .  . 
great .  good .  content .  .  . 
oh ,  yeah ,  he &apos;s got things up and running ,  alright .  .  . 
of course ,  i don &apos;t know every doctor who works here .  .  . 
you can start tomorrow .  and don &apos;t say a word about this to anyone .   is that issue ? 
betty ,  honey ,  listen to me .  a man came by from mutual life insurance .  he says you &apos;ve got money comin &apos; to you from del &apos;s policy .   del &apos;s life insurance policy  -  -  are you with me ? 
 .  .  . of course you do .   you don &apos;t remember me ? 
oh ,  you mean fred . 
she told me i was charming and relentless ,  and would go far in this town .  and she said that unlike the other charming ,  relentless people she knew ,  she liked me . 
no ,  i mean your dedication scares me .  .  . 
you know ,  i almost believe that .  .  .  you &apos;re like a warm breeze that &apos;s suddenly blown into my life .  .  .   i said that to leslie ,  once ,  at her funeral ,  remember ?  .  .  . 
your lines are in the script ,  but you can ad lib . 
why are you doing this to me ? 
well ,  i don &apos;t know what you had in mind ,  but i hope you &apos;re happy .  i put myself on the line for you ,  my reputation ,  and you &apos;re making me look like an idiot . 
i have .  .  .  did it sound that bad ? 
 .  .  . like the water purifiers ? 
uh - huh . 
i &apos;m getting back with my ex - fianc .  he proposed to me right around here ,  so i guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop .  .  . 
dr .  david ravell . 
piss off ,  merle .   so how you gonna find him ,  betty ? 
i can &apos;t believe i remembered that ,  although i suppose i should .  i wrote it .  .  .   but that was seven years ago ,  and you &apos;re quoting it verbatim .  i &apos;m flattered .  .  .  i think .  or frightened .  what &apos;s your name ? 
she called you  &apos;george ,  &apos; george . 
you &apos;re hurting him !  ! 
so why &apos;d you come to l . a .  ? 
hmmm .  sounds like you &apos;ve had a pretty tough go of it with men .  .  . 
what are those for ? 
this isn &apos;t fair ,  you know .  do you always get what you want ? 
rosa ,  so you &apos;ve met david ? 
what ?  no ,  i &apos;m not gonna let you just run out of here .  .  .  you need to talk about what &apos;s going on .  .  . 
blake ,  i can handle that transplant ! 
what part of dixie are you from ,  duane ? 
huh ? 
if you ate at the tip top you did . 
could you give us an example ? 
you did not just say  &quot; injuns ,  &quot;  del . 
i &apos;m all for them owning casinos ,  getting rich off the white man &apos;s greed .  it &apos;s a beautiful piece of irony ,  isn &apos;t it ,  wesley ? 
why not ,  it &apos;ll confuse  &apos;em .  .  .  gotta do something ,  now that you fucked it up . 
we can live with that . 
so how do we know that car &apos;s still in fair oaks ? 
i hope you &apos;re right .  .  . 
what ? 
i &apos;m not telling . 
this doesn &apos;t look like the kind of place betty would go to . 
i said  &apos;got it ?  &apos;
i don &apos;t like talking bad about the dead ,  but now that he &apos;s gone i can tell you she put up with things in that marriage i wouldn &apos;t have .  and yes ,  she ,  of all people ,  was the one who defended him .  and that &apos;s why what that sheriff said makes me so angry . 
but she wanted more out of life ,  right ? 
thank you for your cooperation .   just one more thing .  .  .  did she ever talk about getting rich ? 
isn &apos;t that the point ? 
alright ,  i admit it ,  you had me there .  you &apos;re better than most of them ,  anyway .  .  .  do you have a headshot ? 
she makes me stretch !  i got inside my character last night like i haven &apos;t done in six years on  &quot; reason &quot;  .  it was a totally rejuvenating experience . 
oh ,  of course .  who can forget the emmy ?   then let me bring betty to the set and see what happens . 
it &apos;ll be like live television !  let &apos;s live on the edge a little .  you and i can break the mold here ! 
yeah ?  the sport utility ? 
hey ,  can you sneak me on the lot ? 
you &apos;ve got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone .  that &apos;s not our betty .  .  . 
her show ? 
i see .   did chloe testify ? 
i like to think that i &apos;m a pretty astute observer of the human scene . 
it ain &apos;t the law ! 
that &apos;s right ! 
 .  .  . pete ? 
how &apos;d he know about the treasure ? 
now hold on ,  boys - aintcha ever heard of a negotiation ?  maybe we can talk this thing out !

who was fixing to betray us ! 
so i borrowed it till i did know !

itta bena ,  now ,  uh ,  that would be .  .  . 
they lured me out for a bathe ,  then they dunked me &apos;n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty . 
we prayed to god and he pitied us !

she may not make it through the program ,  but she &apos;s got more heart and more character than you &apos;ll ever have .  i &apos;ve seen your college record .  i &apos;ve never heard of most of those schools .  tell me something ,  mayo .  did you buy that degree ? 
stop eyeballing me ,  mister !  i &apos;ve looked through your file and done a little checking ,  and i know it all .  i know about your mother .  i know your old man &apos;s an alcoholic and a whore chaser .   life sure has dealt you some shitty cards !  hasn &apos;t it ,  mayo ?

i want to fly ,  sir ! 
i &apos;m busy ,  mayo .  it &apos;ll have to wait . 
i know . 
stop eyeballing me ,  boy !  you are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye .  use your peripheral vision !  understand ?  !

everywhere and nowhere ,  paula the polack . 
my father is a rear admiral in the seventh fleet . 
i hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband . 
i don &apos;t care what the magazines say .  .  .  it &apos;s just not as easy being a girl ,  especially from a catholic family .  you don &apos;t know the junk i grew up listening to ,   &apos;bout the way women are supposed to think and act . 
the thing that really got to me .  .  .  she didn &apos;t leave a note .  nothing .  i &apos;ve always hated her for that . 
hey ,  what about sunday dinner ?  when &apos;re you gonna let me know ? 
some day .  when i &apos;m sure i can do a better job of it than my folks . 
hey !  you know goddamn well what happened so let &apos;s not play any games ,  okay ? 
i &apos;ll never get it polished in time .  give me a buckle ,  zack . 
the kid on the windy side of the baker &apos;s window .  that &apos;s how he put it . 
jets . 
calm down ,  sweet pea .  she seen a doctor ? 
it &apos;s a big religious thing with her and she won &apos;t even discuss it . 
he said open it . 
yes . 
yeah ,  just like a half hour ,  maybe a little more ,  and your mom &apos;ll give it to you .   you can wait a half hour ,  can &apos;t you ? 
the walls are steel ,  right ? 
unless daddy comes back later . 
not if we keep  &apos;em here .   you can &apos;t kidnap somebody in their own house .  it &apos;s just breaking and entering ,  unless we take  &apos;em someplace .   or something like that ,  i &apos;m pretty sure . 
she said she did . 
be quiet . 
they &apos;re coughing . 
cell phone . 
 &apos;bout four o &apos;clock . 
you don &apos;t look so good . 
master bath . 
oh ,  i &apos;ve seen these .  .  . 
that door is a safely hazard . 
suit yourself . 
 -  -  seventeen feet wide ,  fifty - five feet deep ,  forty - two hundred square feet ,  four floors with a rentable basement apartment ,  so five altogether ,  courtyard in back  -  - 
478 .  .  . 
damn it ! 
 &quot; what we want is in that room .  &quot; 
i &apos;m sorry . 
okay ,  you just gotta calm yourself down ,  that &apos;s all ,  just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you &apos;ll be fine . 
alma !  ?  i uhh i don &apos;t think .  .  . 
uhh .  .  .  i with it sister but .  .  . 
those ain &apos;t cops . 
okay now ,  er ,  huey ,  so what &apos;s your telephone number ? 
what ?  we &apos;re the leadership ,  you and me .  there ain &apos;t enough of us to .  .  . 
yeah .  .  .  sounds like the constitution to me .  with a little of the bill of rights thrown in .  .  . 
like ? 
sit down ,  this concerns you too .   i don &apos;t need to say that your department &apos;s handling of the black panthers  -  -  particularly inspector brimmer &apos;s  &quot; undercover operation &quot;  has been a complete travesty . 
spontaneous my ass !  !  you told the press and you don &apos;t tell me .  remember you &apos;re working for us . 
hey .  .  .  what the hell you doing ? 
go !  run !  go on !  get the fuck out of here !  ! 
god damn .  .  .  kid never had a chance .  .  . 
sabu .  .  .  high white dude &apos;s the only thing you could hustle . 
i ain &apos;t gonna tell you no more .  no pushing in the neighborhood ,  especially not on my fucking street .  you &apos;re killing your own people asshole . 
 .  .  . glad you came man . 
man ,  did you see huey down on grove street ?  all up on that cop ,  that was beautiful . 
i want it duly noted ,  that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the oakland police department .  the fbi doesn &apos;t have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations ,  my friend .  as i &apos;ve said before ,  agent rodgers ,  we have things under control in our city .  .  . 
these are memos from the commissioner ,  the mayor and hoover himself ,  putting the black panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the bureau . 
yes sir ,  i did . 
huh ,  well then .  .  .   did someone else start shooting ? 
granted ,  the free huey thing has become a bit of a rallying cry for the left .  .  . 
we put our lives on the line today .  malcolm x &apos;s widow was on the line today .  and your guns weren &apos;t even loaded . 
welcome brother ,  have you decided to get down with us ? 
i saw .  .  .  but .  .  . 
you better just kill me tyrone .  and when huey gets out ,  when oakland &apos;s just wall to wall junkies ,  you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got .  i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be real happy about that . 
we &apos;ll all get out of here together . 
motherfuck .  .  .  well then i got something to do . 
yeah .  .  .  cop hit me .  .  . 
you meet those friends of yours in jail too ? 
if i &apos;d known you were going to look like this ,  i never would have put ink in your tea . 
goodbye ,  charlotte . 
what unit ? 
we did . 
you are familiar with how these things are done .   in fact ,  i would like to claim aggrieved status . 
their names ,  ranks and posts ? 
colonel tarleton ,  you deal with these damned rebels . 
do you see that ,  colonel ? 
what news ? 
did your father teach you humility ? 
lord cornwallis is brilliant .   his weakness is that he knows it . 
fourteen dead ,  eleven wounded ,  eighteen captured . 
father ,  there &apos;s something else i need to talk to you about . 
sir ,  i &apos;d like to request a furlough .  two days ? 
tarleton has a list of our men ,  most are on it .   a regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list ,  burning them ,  killing whomever resists ,  women and children ,  as well . 
we buried them ,  then we went to track .   it was a cold trail and they were moving fast .   we went faster .  we caught up to them at kentucky ford . 
it was a different time ,  son .   and you &apos;re a better man than that . 
if this war is about more than thomas ,  it &apos;s about more than anne ,  as well .   stay the course . 
royal petition ,  delegates to court ,  judicial redress ,  economic boycott ,  bribery .  .  . 
 .  .  .  time ,  royal succession ,  regicide ,  bribery .  .  . 
one of yours ? 
i recognize him now .   is he as imprudent as his father was at his age ? 
i &apos;ll see to it that he serves under me . 
where is he now ? 
francis ,  tell me about general cornwallis . 
father ,  i saw a post rider at the house . 
father ? 
father .  .  .  i killed those men .  .  . 
but where are we going ,  mr .  crandall ? 
do you know what this place is ,  ellie ?  oh ,  i know you know it &apos;s a boneyard ,  but a bone ain &apos;t nothing and even a whole pile of  &apos;em don &apos;t amount to much .  do you know what a graveyard really is ? 
yes ,  but the rope might be -  - 
i want to fly it !  can i fly it now ,  mommy ! 
paxcow says daddy &apos;s going to do something really bad .  he -  - 
yes . 
have you got a death - wish ,  ellen ? 
yeah ,  sure . 
was it pascow ? 
what were you listening to ? 
no need to apologize . 
what do you mean ? 
i &apos;m not climbing that . 
there &apos;s a lot of funny things down this way ,  louis . 
what are those for ? 
jud ,  why am i doing all this ? 
well ,  she was a little upset at first ,  and that &apos;s why i thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night .  .  . you did ,  didn &apos;t you ,  louis ? 
out of the mouths of babes ,  louis . 
your father - in - law packs a wallop ,  for an old guy .  he and his wife gone back to chicago ? 
the door must not be opened .  the barrier must not be crossed . 
i &apos;ll tell you where the ground is sour -  - the ground in my heart is sour .  let me tell you something else ,  vic - baby :  wrong is wrong . 
don &apos;t be silly .  church is not going to die . 
that &apos;s enough of that kind of talk ! 
you &apos;ll be fine ,  ellie .  now you can be excused .  go and wash your face . 
well ,  honey .  .  . you know that .  .  . 
i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t go with you to missy &apos;s funeral .  and that i blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard . 
i told you last night -  - this can be the start of patching things up with your folks .  if something good doesn &apos;t come of gage &apos;s death ,  i think i &apos;ll go crazy . 
that boat is my livelihood ! 
no !   you gave your word ! 
i &apos;ll watch my back . 
it &apos;s pure evil to make a captain walk the plank of his own ship ,  twice in one lifetime .   no good can come of it . 
the situation has changed . 
just so you know ,  jack  -  -  i don &apos;t think you &apos;re that clever .   i think you &apos;re a fool .   a mortal fool . 
because it &apos;s what you &apos;re searching for .   you &apos;ve been searching for it for years .   i recognize this ship .  i saw it eight years ago ,  when we made the crossing from england . 
and how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that ?   a family heirloom ,  perhaps ? 
do you not know what this is ,  then ? 
i think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate . 
man overboard ! 
on his heels !   gillette ,  bring a squad down from the fort !   elizabeth ,  are you  -  - 
commodore ,  i beg you  -  -  please do this  .  .  .  for me .   as a wedding gift . 
elizabeth ,  i hereby withdraw my proposal . 
i &apos;m glad we got here in time . 
it doesn &apos;t ! 
has it changed since the last time you were here ? 
what ?   what &apos;s wrong ?   how will this help us get off the island ? 
you should look at our contretemps this way :  we &apos;ve got shade trees ,  thank the lord .   we &apos;ve got some food on the trees ,  thank the lord again .   and we &apos;ve got rum ,  praise the lord .   we can stay alive a month ,  maybe more .   keep a weather eye open for passing ships ,  and our chances are fair . 
oh ,  there &apos;s a hard tale ,  jack .  most of the decent pirates in town won &apos;t sail with you  -  -  seem to think you &apos;re a jinx . 
say again ? 
blast it ,  i &apos;m already awake ! 
how do we expect to find an island no one can find  -  -  with a compass that doesn &apos;t work ? 
sir !   shall i break out the cannons ? 
sir ,  i &apos;ll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise . 
what &apos;s your name ? 
taking stock :  you &apos;ve got a pistol with only one shot ,  a compass that doesn &apos;t point north  .  .  .  and no ship .   you are without a doubt the worst pirate i have ever heard of . 
you look familiar  .  .  .  have i ever threatened you before ? 
because you &apos;re a pirate . 
we &apos;re going to steal a ship ?   that ship ? 
for a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats ,  you &apos;re a quick study . 
tortuga ? 
but i survived .   and i still have that single shot .   it &apos;s meant for one man .   my mutinous first mate -  - 
what &apos;s that ? 
on what ? 
what happened here ? 
but  -  - 
how long do you leave him in there ? 
you can &apos;t mean that . 
something to drink ,  dr .  bright ? 
the body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air ,  there has been nothing sacred about nature .  nature is the enemy ,  mr .  o &apos;brien ,  and science is our greatest weapon against her . 
as you can see i am a new man ,  just like you . 
like rotting meat . 
icky !   what &apos;s happening ? 
gently ,  ott .   gently . 
consideration ? 
this is what my entire life has been directed at ,  this moment ,  this threshold . 
it will be an ascension . 
okay .   alright .   okey - dokey .   now ,  we need the nanobot .   the nanobot that initiated the reaction .   once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown .   simple really .   no problem . 
she could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys . 
dr .  makeo is working on it now ,  sir .  i estimate at least another six hours . 
yeah ,  i do ! 
here ,  kid ,  this is great stuff .   why don &apos;t you give it a try ? 
do you remember about five years ago ,  that uh .  .  .  incident at purnell labs ? 
there &apos;s a guard outside my door !  i &apos;m a prisoner ,  nigel !   do you understand that ? 
is that what argon told you ? 
really ?   what have you been doing ? 
somebody has to . 
i &apos;ve been thinking about you a lot all these years ,  locked up in my cell .   i &apos;d tear through every issue of the midwest science journal looking for your latest findings ,  watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies ,  the fruit fly .   exciting stuff .   i got to tell you ,  it really kept me going . 
and what i love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think .   it unifies the entire world on a single level .  everything is completely connected .  sometimes i can really feel it ,  everything around us ,  just a small part of a whole .   it &apos;s really wonderful . 
i &apos;m sorry i brought the whole thing up !   if you &apos;re gonna flip your wig  -  - 
please ,  susan !   i need help !  something is wrong with me ! 
they did it to me ! 
what are these ? 
the nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid ,  so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a good year tire than a human being . 
the problem is the by - product created by the process . 
the replicators start off like assemblers ,  but the replicators never stabilize . 
susan ! 
just like old times . 
did you go ? 
oh no .   they &apos;re trying to blame you for the accident .   that means they must not have been able to control the replicators . 
we &apos;ve got to get the nanobot . 
you &apos;re not going after argon ! 
god ,  when we were in that store all i could think about was that one time ,  when we were in school ,  and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal .   do you remember that ? 
god ,  what a fight that was . 
this is wonderfully accommodating of you all .   now i won &apos;t have to come looking for you . 
yeah ,  i have something i &apos;ve been meaning to give you . 
mrs .  argon ?   it &apos;s sim . 
okay ,  barbie ,  let &apos;s get this over with . 
well ,  what else do you expect them to call you ? 
miss wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need ,  miss gallagher . 
goodbye ,  miss gallagher . 
i think i better go ,  stew . 
you &apos;re not going to print this silly thing ,  are you ? 
i &apos;m not interested in your literary recommendations . 
just listen to this  adorable babykins does her miss her baby ?  him sends his booful li &apos;l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses .  bobo is so lonely ! 
really ? 
hello ,  natalie .  mr .  stewart smith  .   .   .  miss montgomery ,  mrs .  eames ,  mrs .  radcliff ,  mr .  radcliff
oh ,  mother will give us the blue room .  you haven &apos;t a red room ,  have you ?   well ,  bless her heart .  wouldn &apos;t that be nice !  my ,  oh my  -  six rooms and two baths and a blue room .  i guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it ,  wouldn &apos;t she ? 
you have the cutest nose i &apos;ve
what do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat ? 
i know that . 
darling ,  i don &apos;t care whether you can look gallagher in the face or not ,  but you &apos;re gonna be a good boy and wear garters . 
you know ,  stewart ,  you failed to mention that miss gallagher was a very beautiful young girl . 
that was kind of a rotten thing to do ,  anne .  after all ,  gallagher is my friend .  the least you can do is be courteous to her . 
think of the fun we can have  -  we &apos;ll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet &apos;s ford .  how &apos;s that ? 
now wait ,  don &apos;t get excited ,  anne .  there &apos;s no reason for that .  perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink .  that &apos;s all right .  i &apos;m sorry .  i &apos;ll go right down and throw them out .  that &apos;s no reason for you to take this attitude .  after all ,  i certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house ,  haven &apos;t i ? 
this is something i should have done a long time ago ,  only i didn &apos;t have sense enough to do it .  no ,  i had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that i knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning .  but no more .  no more !  so that &apos;s that . 
you should have known better than to write ,  romeo .  i found that out a long time ago . 
splendid ,  mother .  let &apos;s hop over to monte carlo .  it &apos;s a great place to save a face . 
oh ,  the usual thing .  blah ,  blah ,  blah attended the blah ,  blah reception and wore the same blah ,  blah things . 
i want to see stew smith .  oh excuse me  -  i mean mr .  smith . 
this way . 
oh ,  is that so ? 
what do you want ? 
i bring a message from garcia . 
it &apos;s all right .  you can write your own ticket .  a hundred and fifty bucks a week . 
big chief bingy come to white man &apos;s tepee to make friends .  big chief very sorry .  to show how sorry  -  will bend over and let white man kick big chief where sun never shines . 
look ,  i quit ! 
yeah . 
yeah  -  and get us into a million dollar libel suit .  it wouldn &apos;t be the first time .  now ,  you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady ,  the sister ,  or the kid .  any of them  -  but get it . 
what expenses ?  all you need is carfare to long island .  you &apos;d better get a shave and a shine ,  because you ,  you &apos;re going to have a tough time getting in there as it is . 
well ,  when are you quitting ? 
is that so ? 
what are you doing fooling around in here ? 
say ,  you are nice .  you &apos;re all right .  you &apos;d make a good wife . 
are you trying to tell me that i need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up ? 
now i &apos;m sorry .  i appreciate your efforts .  but i don &apos;t need anybody to help me button my pants  -  i &apos;ve been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right ,  and i can button  &apos;em with one hand as a matter of fact . 
yes ,  sir .  very good ,  sir . 
yes . 
i was sent from the post in place of our social editor . 
oh sure ,  we &apos;ll be happy .  what &apos;s the matter with your eyes ? 
ah !  thank you ,  joe .   tell you what  -  we &apos;ll have one of those parties down at your house  -  one of those spaghetti parties ,  you know .  gee ,  we haven &apos;t had one of those in a long time ,  have we gallagher ? 
remember ,  she &apos;s a schuyler . 
oh no ,  you won &apos;t ,  mr .  smith .  you &apos;re a married man now .  mother always warned me never to run around with married men . 
oh ,  i &apos;ll call you up some time .  and if your social duties permit  -  why  - 
i &apos;m pinch - hitting for our society editor tonight .  i wanted to see some life in the raw . 
gee gallagher ,  do you look good !  what are you doing to yourself ? 
my mistake  -  she &apos;s glaring . 
no ,  no .  strange ,  i &apos;ve never seen anne act that way before .   it &apos;s funny i never thought to tell her you were a girl ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
how far have you gotten ? 
did who ? 
isn &apos;t he the one that always writes about things  -  only the things he knows about ? 
didn &apos;t he go to sea before he wrote about it ? 
now ,  we &apos;ve got it right up to where the boy &apos;s wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters  -  how &apos;s that ? 
a statement ?  good . 
thanks .  may i sit down ? 
i don &apos;t eat waffles . 
she wants me to arrange the financial settlement . 
remember what i told you about that twentieth crack ?  all right ,  you &apos;ve just made it .  before you go unconscious i want you to get this through your nut . 
we just thought that
yes . 
i sort of invited him along to bend an elbow .  you don &apos;t mind ,  do you ? 
now ,  now jeeves .  &#93 5] was that nice ?  was that being a gentleman ,  jeeves ?  was it ,  jeeves ?  your name is jeeves ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
you try it . 
oh no ,  sir .  some people are natural putterers .  others can never master it . 
yes . 
it isn &apos;t done ,  gentlemen !  it isn &apos;t done ,  i say !  it isn &apos;t done ! 
what ? 
you sure you want to know this ? 
wait . 
thank you . 
oh ,  hi  .  .  . 
so i know i haven &apos;t been steady with anybody ,  but i just don &apos;t want to rush it .  you don &apos;t want to make a mistake with something that important . 
what i mean is  .  .  .  mary sue &apos;s been a little  &quot; different &quot;  lately  .  .  . 
what &apos;ll it be ? 
but it could happen . 
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve noticed the same things we all have -  - certain  &quot; changes &quot;  going on in the town .   you know what i mean by  &quot; changes &quot;  ? 
 &quot; changes .  &quot;   and it &apos;s not just the fire or big stuff like that .  it &apos;s little things .   did you hear about bill miller ? 
do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness ? 
i think i &apos;ve got something to say . 
it &apos;s like the basketball team . 
you put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station . 
how &apos;d you know about the fire ? 
mr .  simpson  .  .  . 
what color is that hedge of yours ? 
do you mind .  this is like the most important moment of my whole life . 
i don &apos;t believe this . 
i looked in the library .  they got covers with nothing inside them . 
jennifer ! 
i &apos;ve worn some kinky stuff before  .  .  . 
what do you mean ? 
you can &apos;t do this ,  jennifer .  i warned you . 
you don &apos;t understand .  you &apos;re messing with their universe . 
d . h .  lawrence .  you ever heard of him ? 
yeah  .  .  . 
gone out with you .  she woulda like rearranged your tonsils . 
and you &apos;re sure about this ? 
no .  i baked them for you . 
hi . 
sure  .  .  .  where would we go ? 
yeah  .  .  .  i guess .   i don &apos;t know . 
so what &apos;s it like ? 
real rain ? 
what do we do ? 
it &apos;s beautiful .  where &apos;d you get it ? 
i know how i &apos;d feel if mine went out .  almost like losing a friend . 
yeah  .  .  . 
say -  - why don &apos;t you take this remote instead .  it &apos;s got a little more  &quot; ooomph &quot;  in it . 
don &apos;t get upset . 
look  .  .  . 
because you &apos;re coming home . 
so  .  .  .  i guess as long as i &apos;m here ,  all sorts of things could happen to this place .  we could have pink lawns and blue trees  .  .  . 
bud  .  .  . 
look ,  you can &apos;t always like what you do .  sometimes you just do it because it &apos;s your job .  and even if you don &apos;t like it ,  you just gotta do it anyway . 
you know what i really like ? 
wow  .  .  .  that &apos;s pretty good  .  .  . 
you think you could do this like soon ?  it &apos;s almost six thirty . 
oh god  .  .  . 
this is barry . 
did you think that we &apos;d all be looking at you ? 
it &apos;s extension 215 if you want to try me back . 
what &apos;s the listing ? 
yes but i get tense and i feel like i can &apos;t be myself if that happens . 
well ,  yeah ,  thank you ,  but  -  - 
you just said very food . 
hey ,  hey ,  you should ask her out  -  -  what do you think ,  she &apos;s cute ,  right ? 
it &apos;s not cool ? 
yeah i can &apos;t . 
you &apos;re so scared . 
no she didn &apos;t; that &apos;s a lie . 
where are you ? 
really ? 
no . 
yes . 
yes . 
you have trouble ,  financial trouble ? 
yes i can &apos;t .  .  .  . i don &apos;t make enough money to be able to do that . 
hello ? 
this makes me very uncomfortable . 
come on ,  i thought we had fun ,  rich boy  -  - 
are you telling me no ? 
hello ? 
i thought they opened at seven .   if i left my car would it be ok ? 
can i ask you ,  can i trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them ?  barry ok . 
maybe i &apos;ll see you later ,  when i pick up my car ? 
hi . 
oh my god . 
i &apos;m going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me ? 
do you want to pick me up ? 
 -  -  the promotion says :  buy any 10 healthy choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1 , 000 for purchases made with a special coupon .  so in the supermarket ,  you notice their products ,  first you notice they have a teriyaki chicken dinner at $1 . 79  -  that &apos;s a pretty good deal .  .  .  . but then i noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can .  .  .  .  . and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it &apos;s a really amazing deal because i stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup .  now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label .  that &apos;s those little bar codes ,  you know ?  the universal product codes ? 
my friend carlos is doing it who works with me .  it &apos;s his .  it &apos;s his pudding ,  he &apos;s doing it .  it &apos;s not mine .  he &apos;s crazy .  i told him not to do it .  he &apos;s the one who &apos;s insane .  he only spent about one hundred dollars so far though  -  - 
what happened ? 
did you pick it up from the street ? 
ok .  .  .  . well .  .  . i &apos;m gonna go . 
i don &apos;t know . 
i don &apos;t ,  no matter what my sisters say ,  ok ? 
i don &apos;t freak out . 
well let &apos;s do something do you want to do something ,  can you meet me ? 
 .  .  . what .  .  .  ? 
for work .  .  .  .  . 
it &apos;s a plastic ,  yeah . 
did you have my home phone number ? 
i &apos;m gonna have to ask you to leave . 
hi ,  is this your first time calling ? 
and your billing address and the name as it appears on the card ? 
no one will know your name . 
why don &apos;t you shut the fuck up ? 
you go fuck yourself .  you go fuck yourself .  you go fuck yourself .  my love was hurt ,  she got hurt .  i am in love with her and you hurt you and you are gonna fucking get hurt .  you don &apos;t touch her ,  i love her . 
you better watch your mouth ,  cunt ,  you &apos;re gonna get hurt . 
you do guaranteed sale ?  etc . 
yeah . 
i know that .  maybe you know other doctors ? 
i don &apos;t have anyone to talk to things about and i understand it &apos;s confidential with a doctor  -  i &apos;m embarrassed about that and i don &apos;t want my sisters to know ? 
yeah .  .  .  .  . you got here early huh ? 
what happened ? 
 .  .  .  . now :  this pudding ? 
hey . 
hey .  you made a fucking sex call and now you &apos;re gonna pay .  it &apos;s not a big thing  -  -  just give us some money and then it &apos;s over  -  -  we &apos;ll just walk down to the atm and get your money out  -  - 
each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that .  .  . it &apos;s for a giveaway .  .  . a product giveaway by this company .  .  . 
yes i am . 
i won &apos;t . 
i know . 
 -  -  she didn &apos;t know what she was talking about  -  - 
so they &apos;ll go . 
it &apos;s ok .  that &apos;s alright . 
they need to see the new 484 &apos;s to make sure it works with their oc .  .  .  . 
so .  .  . did my brother call you ? 
i &apos;ll just see you when you get back here . 
you &apos;ve been to his quarters ,  haven &apos;t you ? 
if you &apos;re going to slander him ,  then you don &apos;t deserve to hear his stories  -  - 
yes ,  well ,  i awoke to discover i &apos;d turned into a cat .  if you don &apos;t do as i say ,  i &apos;ll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks ,  and suck the marrow straight out of your bones . 
 &quot; one day ,  fanchon &apos;s first client was a surgeon .  he ran his fingers across her naked skin ,  pulling apart folds of flesh ,  inspecting each and every follicle .  .  .  &quot; 
then how can we know who is truly good ,  and who is evil ? 
charenton has changed; it &apos;s not safe for you here . 
and  -  -  ? 
it &apos;s that doctor fellow ,  isn &apos;t it ?  he &apos;s come to usurp your place here ,  hasn &apos;t he ? 
they can &apos;t be serious . 
if you only mean to dupe me again  -  - 
you mean to take us all down with you ? 
what the devil  -  - 
start with the bible; it &apos;s cheerier ,  and more artfully written . 
i have a proposition . 
 -  -  water !   -  - 
i didn &apos;t create this world of ours !  i only record it ! 
indiscretions ,  abbe ?  please .  i &apos;ve read his case history .  at sixteen ,  he violated a serving girl with a crucifix .  after six months in the dungeon at vincennes ,  he mutilated a prostitute ,  cutting her flesh with a razor ,  then cauterizing the wounds with wax  -  - 
he &apos;s more than a patient ,  doctor; the marquis is my friend  -  - 
madame bougival; mademoiselle clairwil  -  -  and of course  -  -  the marquis &apos; wife  -  - 
as you say ,  doctor . 
 &quot; as he loosened his manhood from beneath his robes ,  the bishop muttered a latin prayer .  and then  -  -  with a mighty thrust  -  -  drove it into her very entrails  -  -  &quot; 
as for the author .  .  .  shoot him . 
yes ? 
if you won &apos;t read it to your own mama ,  then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all . 
 &quot; a habitu of cemeteries ,  his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior ,  deceased a dozen years .  &quot; 
most assuredly . 
they &apos;ve taken your clothes ? 
he &apos;s a man of god; he &apos;s true to his vows . 
it needn &apos;t be; not if you &apos;ve another story . 
a tale more horrible than all the rest combined ! 
i beg to differ ,  doctor .  you work in a madhouse .  your every waking moment is governed by the insane . 
you &apos;re new to charenton ,  yes ?  perhaps you &apos;re not yet familiar with my husband ,  and his unusual case . 
i am eternally in your debt . 
you &apos;ve no right to assault me in this fashion; i &apos;ll call for my footman .  i &apos;ll have you removed  -  - 
how was i to know ,  my darling ? 
i beg you ,  donatien .  .  .  as your wife .  .  .  your only ally .  .  .  you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself . 
tell me; have you done anything to secure my release ?  no !  have you petitioned the court ?  never !  sought audience with the emperor  -  - 
so you ever gonna do a picture ? 
we &apos;ve known each other too long ,  orson .  sling the bullshit elsewhere .

does he have your number ,  mr .  jefferies ? 
like disposing of their wives ? 
of course ,  it &apos;s normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope . 
i &apos;ll admit it all has a mysterious sound  -  -  but is could mean a number of different things .  murder is the least likely . 
you told me .   i &apos;ve got to run ,  jeff . 
at the risk of sounding stuffy ,  jeff  -  -  i &apos;ll remind you of the constitution ,  and the phrase  &quot; search warrant &quot;  issued by a judge who knows the bill of rights verbatim .  he must ask for evidence . 
i can hear myself starting out .   &quot; your honor  -  -  i have a friend who &apos;s an amateur sleuth ,  an one night ,  after a heavy supper  -  -  &quot;   he &apos;d throw the new york state penal code right in my face .   -  -  and it &apos;s six volumes . 
jefferies . 
my lisa .  she went into thorwald &apos;s apartment ,  and he came back .  the only way i could get her out was to call the police . 
a fact !  last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden .  why ?  because he had something buried in there .  something a dog could scent . 
that &apos;s too bad ,  jeff .  well ,  i guess i can &apos;t be lucky every day .  forget i called . 
didn &apos;t i tell you !  didn &apos;t i tell you it was the next place to watch ? 
swell .  i get myself half - killed for you  -  -  and you reward me by stealing my assignments .

now stop wasting time ,  thorwald ,  or i &apos;ll hang up and call the police . 
gives your circulation something to fight .   what kind of trouble ? 
that &apos;s normal . 
that &apos;s abnormal . 
she &apos;s only perfect . 
and she &apos;ll end up fat ,  alcoholic and miserable . 
no . 
and you love life ? 
that dress should be listed on the stock exchange . 
something big going on somewhere ? 
big enough ? 
i couldn &apos;t think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you &apos;ve been through .  and the last week must be the hardest . 
someday you might want to open up your own studio here . 
i could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit . 
well ,  she picked the most prosperous looking one . 
lisa ,  simmer down  -  -  will you ? 
don &apos;t you ever have any problems ? 
jeff  -  -  if you could only see yourself . 
it &apos;s pretty hard to stay away from that word isn &apos;t is ? 
yeah . 
it doesn &apos;t seem to be in any hurry . 
i wonder where he &apos;s going now ? 
well ,  i guess it &apos;s safe to put on some lights now . 
all day long i &apos;ve tried to keep my mind on work . 
what doesn &apos;t ? 
they do not !  and they don &apos;t leave it behind them .  a woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup ,  perfume and jewelry . 
you are .  you have a talent for creating difficult situations . 
i &apos;ll rephrase the question .

i don &apos;t know what he did to her ,  but she got even . 
now vic was tellin &apos; me ,  he &apos;s got a parole problem . 
we were set up ,  the cops were waiting for us . 
the boots and socks in gardena .  when we got there ,  i met joe and a guy named mr .  white .  it &apos;s a phony name .  my name &apos;s mr .  orange . 
who ,  mr .  white ? 
a little . 
the brewers . 
what kinds questions did cabot ask ? 
but what is this ? 
i gotta memorize all this shit ? 
 .  .  . her brother usually goes with her ,  but he &apos;s in county unexpectedly . 
who &apos;s your parole officer ? 
no ,  she did it .  she killed the cheatin &apos; wife ,  too . 
joe ,  i don &apos;t know what you think you know ,  but you &apos;re wrong . 
joe ,  trust me on this ,  you &apos;ve made a mistake .  he &apos;s a good kid .  i understand you &apos;re hot ,  you &apos;re super - fuckin &apos; pissed .  we &apos;re all real emotional .  but you &apos;re barking up the wrong tree .  i know this man ,  and he wouldn &apos;t do that . 
he was the only one i wasn &apos;t a hundred percent on .  i should have my fucking head examined for goin &apos; forward when i wasn &apos;t a hundred percent .  but he seemed like a good kid ,  and i was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up . 
okay ramblers ,  let &apos;s get to rambling .  wait a minute ,  who didn &apos;t throw in ? 
i know . 
that fucking bastard !  that fucking sick fucking bastard ! 
joe ,  you want me to shoot him for you ? 
what &apos;re you talkin &apos; about ? 
i told  &apos;em not to touch the alarm .  they touched it .  i blew  &apos;em full of holes .  if they hadn &apos;t done what i told  &apos;em not it ,  they &apos;d still be alive . 
hey ,  just cancel that shit right now !  you &apos;re hurt .  you &apos;re hurt really fucking bad ,  but you ain &apos;t dying . 
can you believe the songs they been playin &apos; ? 
i &apos;d go over twelve percent for that . 
gun shot . 
i haven &apos;t had a chance to think .  first i was just trying to get the fuck outta there .  and after we got away ,  i &apos;ve just been dealin &apos; with him . 
okay ,  let &apos;s go through what happened .  we &apos;re in the place ,  everything &apos;s going fine .  then the alarm gets tripped .  i turn around and all these cops are outside .  you &apos;re right ,  it was like ,  bam !  i blink my eyes are they &apos;re there .  everybody starts going apeshit .  then mr .  blonde starts shootin &apos; all the  - 
no real people ? 
could you believe mr .  blonde ? 
i think he &apos;s a sick fuckin &apos; maniac !  we &apos;re awful goddamn lucky he didn &apos;t tag us ,  when he shot up the place .  i came this fucking close  -   to taking his ass out myself .  everybody panics .  when things get tense ,  everybody panics .  everybody .  i don &apos;t care what your name is ,  you can &apos;t help it .  it &apos;s human nature .  but ya panic on the inside .  ya panic in your head .  ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic ,  then you get a grip and deal with the situation .  what you don &apos;t do ,  is shoot up the place and kill everybody . 
i got  &apos;em ,  all right ? 
no ,  they &apos;re not in the car .  no ,  i don &apos;t have them on me .  ya wanna go with me and get  &apos;em ?  yes ,  we can go right now .  but first listen to what i &apos;m telling you .  we were fuckin &apos; set up !  somebody is in league with the cops .  we got a judas in our midst .  and i &apos;m thinkin &apos; we should have our fuckin &apos; heads examined for waiting around here . 
so what do you suggest ,  we go to a hotel ?  we got a guy who &apos;s shot in the belly ,  he can &apos;t walk ,  he bleeds like a stuck pig ,  and when he &apos;s awake ,  he screams in pain . 
he seems all right now ,  but he went crazy in the store . 
not these guys . 
hello graham  -  -  joe  -  -  mr .  gardner . 
what &apos;s she doin &apos; runnin &apos; around the country at night . 
tell them to come on in . 
and this is helen carter . 
yes ,  ma &apos;am . 
our kind of women ? 
so am i . 
thanks .  and isn &apos;t there something we can do about supper  -  -  or making the beds ? 
but you eat ,  don &apos;t you ? 
learnin &apos; to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street . 
better go on back and get some more sleep .  you &apos;ll need it later on . 
i don &apos;t know .  i thought i did .  now i &apos;m not sure .  i thought it had something to do with me . 
i &apos;m awake now .  go on .  say what you want to say .  i &apos;ll listen . 
i  -  -  lost something . 
sure a lot of guys lookin &apos; for lednov . 
where &apos;d they go ? 
there was only three of them at first .  i guess i lost my head . 
okeh ,  i was wrong .  but you can &apos;t expect a fellow who never saw lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin &apos; .  you &apos;ve been sorta close mouthed about him . 
sure i remember .  you went to mexico lookin &apos; for cattle . 
i guess so  -  -  but don &apos;t make a habit of it . 
i can &apos;t take her with me . 
you can &apos;t stay here .  there &apos;s snakes and it &apos;s cold and you &apos;ll just get sicker . 
suppose that lednov was to have found you ,  instead of me .  why you wouldn &apos;t have had a chance . 
don &apos;t act so  -  -  crazy . 
helen  -  -  why don &apos;t you and mary go on with clay ? 
of course i do  -  -  but it &apos;d be better for you  -  -  and the house is kind of small  -  - 
that something i shouldn &apos;t see ? 
that sure smells good . 
i figure we &apos;ll get along just fine . 
what &apos;s the matter  -  -  restless ? 
and you &apos;re all alone . 
until you came along we were going to sonora . 
with a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other . 
how do you know who we are ? 
we got to get movin &apos; . 
he dropped a shoe .  you shouldn &apos;t be ridin &apos; him . 
that won &apos;t help the stone bruise .  you ain &apos;t been around horses much ,  looks like . 
pleased to meet you ,  ma &apos;am .   we found your trunk .  were you doin &apos; the driven &apos; ? 
gee ,  i can &apos;t . 
i &apos;m too old for it ,  miss wells .  .  .  that &apos;s for little kids . 
what comes after z ? 
sometimes not knowin &apos; how to read has its points .  you can &apos;t read books so you look at people and figure  &apos;em out . 
like when you were standin &apos; there looking after clay .  i knew right off what you were thinking .  because i &apos;ve been watching you . 
she was only teasin &apos; . 
for the last ten miles i &apos;ve been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up .  i &apos;m getting to the point where i don &apos;t think there &apos;s any place named sonora . 
you stretch out .  i &apos;ll fix something to eat . 
that &apos;s always tough .  how long were you together ? 
hey ,  brenda .

oh my god ,  the ghost has buddy !  brenda do something !

hello . 
listen to your dirty mouth ,  you fucking whore ! 
did you see her ?  !  she just said  &quot; fuck you &quot;  to me ! 
that &apos;s not gum in your mouth ,  is it ? 
and who may i ask is carl ? 
i &apos;m stoodup !  i &apos;ll kill that bastard ! 
it &apos;s just not your day ,  is it rosemary ? 
just the damn cable tv company .  you know how they are .  did you hear about dottie hinkle ? 
mrs .  ackerman ,  when you left me at the flea - market ,  where did you go ? 
mrs .  sutphin ,  i &apos;m paul stubbins ,  chip &apos;s math teacher . 
what was that ? 
the name may not mean anything to you ,  young lady ,  but say the word and i &apos;ll have your sister for you in forty - eight hours . 
that &apos;s what i tried to find out .  i went to la jeunesse    -  -  used a phony health inspector &apos;s badge  they let me go through the works  -  -  all but one room .  that room was locked .  i &apos;d like to see the inside of that room . 
you can &apos;t tell . 
i &apos;ve come from jacqueline .  she needs money . 
it &apos;s not just for myself i &apos;m asking .  her sister is here .  the kid &apos;s half crazy with anxiety . 
well ,  then i can tell you that in addition to other dangers ,  there is a grave danger of jacqueline losing her sanity .  i would advise against you seeing her . 
how much does she want ? 
it &apos;s on peary street .  just ask the people who run it .  they &apos;ll remember her .   people who see miss jacqueline never forget her . 
i can &apos;t see much fun in teaching school .  why don &apos;t you go into the beauty business . 
it always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy . 
what did she want to know ? 
at least i can explain that ,  mary .  your sister had a feeling about life  that it wasn &apos;t worth living unless one could end it .  i helped her get that room . 
this is about another murder  a woman at fifty second street
yes ,  of course  but the police would say you &apos;d probably had a bad dream . 
however ,  i won &apos;t say that i &apos;ll not take charge occasionally ,  and i &apos;m going to take charge new .  i &apos;ve a job for you . 
the people at the restaurant ? 
you could have told me any time you were jacqueline &apos;s husband . 
she &apos;s got to be found .  that &apos;s the first step .  she &apos;s got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police . 
i &apos;ve never loved any one before ,  gregory ,  and i do love you  -  you must know it  -  -  but jacqueline &apos;s my sister  whom i had lost and have found again .  .  .  .    
well ? 
no ! 
i don &apos;t know . 
you &apos;ll be all right ? 
were you going to make a suggestion ? 
at least you knew about dr .  judd . 
i have been at the library . 
i had begun to write again  - that &apos;s whet i was doing when you came in . 
i hate people who try to peddle comfort .  but , mary ,  you shouldn &apos;t mourn for jacqueline .  life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind .  it &apos;s better this way . 
why ,  mr .  jason .  most of these books are on the closed shelf .  you have to get permission . 
i saw you with her last week .  i knew you &apos;d be here tonight .  where is she ? 
see that girl ?  that &apos;s jacqueline &apos;s sister .  it &apos;s because of her i ask . 
yes .  you could become a country wife  -  -  fool around with petunias and pullets . 
i know the theory behind the movement .  if one believes in good one believes in evil .  if one believes in god ,  one must believe in the devil .  and an intelligent person can make his own choice  that &apos;s it ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
but you would like to know where she is ? 
i &apos;m afraid not . 
i &apos;ll be out in a minute . 
if i were you ,  mary  -  -  i &apos;d go back to school .  i &apos;d make no further attempt to find jacqueline . 
once you &apos;d seen my sister you &apos;d never forget her . 
no  -  -  the rent in paid .  the lady asked us to promise ,  i wouldn &apos;t open the door . 
we .  .  .  don &apos;t usually let people smoke in the house .  we have a patio if you  -  - 
have you ever been on television ? 
no ,  not really . 
i don &apos;t know . 
my therapist said that  -  - 
what .  .  .  what are these interviews about ? 
do you think that &apos;s such a good idea ? 
yes .  but i sense the element of revenge here . 
that &apos;s a good question . 
how do you pay for all this ?  i mean ,  rent ,  and tapes and this equipment . 
what will you do when the money runs out ? 
tell me your name . 
is he going to see this ? 
yes .  whenever .  .  .  all right ,  look .  whenever i see a man that i think is attractive ,  i wonder what it would be like with him ,  i mean ,  i &apos;m just curious ,  i don &apos;t act on it ,  but i hate that i think that !  !  i wish i could just forget about that stuff !  ! 
because that &apos;s how cynthia thinks !  !  all she does is think about that stuff ,  and i hate that ,  i don &apos;t want to be like her ,  i don &apos;t want to be like her !  ! 
have you fantasized about me ? 
i remember .  you could do that ,  couldn &apos;t you ?  go down on me ? 
yes . 
yes .  i did .  willfully and repeatedly . 
did you confront john with the fact that you knew about him ? 
subtlety ? 
you should be .  he lied to you .  so did cynthia . 
ann ,  it could happen to me all over again ,  don &apos;t you see ?  i could start to  -  - 
you mean you &apos;re still in contact with her ? 
like maybe a big part ? 
graham ,  i mean ,  what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her ? 
look at you ,  look at what &apos;s happened to you ,  look how you &apos;ve changed !  don &apos;t you think she will have changed ? 
why are you ashamed ? 
i want to know why you are the way you are ! 
oh ,  we get along okay .  she &apos;s just very .  .  .  she &apos;s an extrovert .  i think she &apos;s loud .  she probably wouldn &apos;t agree .  definitely wouldn &apos;t agree . 
graham and i were talking about apartments and i told him to check the garden district ,  there are some nice little places there ,  garage apartments and stuff . 
something wrong ? 
no ,  i &apos;m not .  frankly ,  i &apos;m offended at the accusation . 
ann ,  you are completely paranoid .  not ten minutes ago i wanted to make love for the first time in weeks ,  and you act like i &apos;m dipped in shit .  you know ,  i think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young ,  straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on . 
for god &apos;s sake ,  ann ,  i am not fucking your sister .  i don &apos;t find her that attractive ,  for one . 
i was just saying ,  you know ?  i didn &apos;t get paranoid when you didn &apos;t want to make love .  i could have easily assumed that you didn &apos;t want to because you were having an affair . 
i &apos;m not either !  ! 
i don &apos;t know .  sometimes i feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world . 
goddammit ,  goddammit !  !  that son of a bitch !  !   well ,  at least i know you didn &apos;t fuck him . 
goddam right . 
yes ,  i remember .  what do you do when these moods overtake you ? 
well ,  last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities ,  and now we &apos;re talking about your concern over the garbage problem . 
what do you mean ? 
well ,  the cumulative effect is not good ,  let me tell you .   i knew i shouldn &apos;t have watered those plants . 
i hate my sister . 
ann ,  you don &apos;t have a clue .  look ,  i don &apos;t even know why we &apos;re discussing this ,  i &apos;ll just call him myself . 
because i never got around to it . 
because .  cynthia ,  look ,  john was right .  graham is strange .  very strange .  you don &apos;t want to get involved with him . 
no ,  it &apos;s nothing like that . 
i don &apos;t want to talk about it . 
i wanted him to see me . 
in front of him ,  ann ,  yes . 
listen to you !  !  you sound like mom .  what are you talking about ? 
why ? 
i feel like i do . 
it &apos;s a sun dress . 
thank you . 
do you have my work number ? 
no ,  i touched me . 
well ,  why would she want a sun dress ?  she &apos;s got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins . 
do i know you ? 
how do we start ? 
can i see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what  -  - 
do i sit or stand ? 
describe for me your first sexual experience . 
live ,  or in a photograph or film of some sort ? 
what did you think ?  did it look like you expected ? 
do you think i &apos;m pretty ? 
no . 
i &apos;m sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer . 
i have a friend coming in from out of town ,  i &apos;ll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days . 
afraid of getting caught ? 
how about inviting me over to dinner ? 
when ? 
do you want me to stop calling ? 
shit ,  after what you &apos;ve told me ,  i don &apos;t know .  i should &apos;ve known ,  when he showed up dressed like some arty brat . 
jesus christ .  and he doesn &apos;t have sex with any of them ?  they just talk ? 
jesus .  i could almost understand it if he was screwing these people ,  almost .  why doesn &apos;t he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something ? 
why not ? 
actually ,  no ,  i &apos;ve changed my mind .  i shouldn &apos;t have called . 
i know .  will you please leave now ? 
john ,  we have nothing to talk about . 
everybody has a past . 
have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband ? 
where is he now ?  do you know ? 
make love to me ,  make love to me ,  love ,  love to me .  .  . 
where is this thing that attacked your wife ? 
go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second - degree burns .  it &apos;ll have to do for now .   what &apos;s your number ?  the number of your apartment ? 
yes ?  who is there ? 
right .  it &apos;s crazy .  but here &apos;s the beauty part .  ready ?   who cares ? 
i don &apos;t get it . 
ok .  it &apos;s apartment 1009 ,  south tower ,  starliner towers .  may as well go there directly . 
night night
got the hot flush symptoms and i &apos;m feeling freaky
breaking out
how &apos;s brad ? 
i know ,  i know ,  it &apos;s just .  .  . 
is it because i &apos;m becoming too popular ? 
when do i get to see brad ? 
out of self comes selflessness . 
conspiracy ?   that sounds a little farfetched . 
oh .   ah ,  i &apos;m not calling at an inconvenient moment am i ? 
i &apos;m looking for love
some people do it for for each other
what are you talking about ?  danny slepstrini is a chip off the old block .   i played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week .   and hank says danny &apos;s moved to new york .   to better himself . 
mr .   flavors  -  -  may i have a moment of your time ? 
we &apos;ve heard rumors that you &apos;re going to unveil more than just a new series tonight .   is this true ? 
could you tell us a little about it ?

i &apos;m .  .  . happy . 
is it true they &apos;re all midgets with big heads ? 
he will .   but it &apos;s up to you to reawaken his feelings .   you &apos;ve got to be fabulous ,  look ,  think and appear fabulous .   and farley &apos;s given you that chance .   you can use the breakfast show to knock denton dead . 
that &apos;s an extremely negative response . 
he leaves you smoking .  .  . 
criminal

later . 
what &apos;d christine say ? 
does she know about saturday ? 
i was hoping to get some understanding from you .  and i &apos;m not getting it . 
this is totally different .  i &apos;m talking about avoiding what you &apos;re talking about .  that &apos;s the distinction .  i have not made the commitment yet .  i am not married .  i have not said the words .  in a few days ,  i might get married ,  and if i do ,  then i won &apos;t be doing stuff like this anymore .  otherwise ,  what &apos;s the whole point of getting married ? 
did you ever got ahold of maya yesterday ? 
nice shot . 
what do you think &apos;s going on ? 
did you have trouble performing ?  yeah ,  that &apos;s .  .  . 
no ,  i did not .  must have been gary at the hitching post .  i think we mentioned it to him the first night . 
i &apos;m thinking it &apos;s time to settle down .  one woman .  one house .  you know .  it &apos;s time .

i just wanted you to know i &apos;ve decided not to go to the wedding ,  so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable ,  you know ,  run - in or something ,  well ,  worry no more .  you won &apos;t see me there .  my wedding gift to you and what &apos;s -  his - name .  what is his name ?

pour me a full glass .  i &apos;ll pay for it .

what &apos;s everyone ordering ?  then we can sort out the wine . 
hi ,  guys .  we should probably get going . 
a famous actor who &apos;s getting married next week . 
what &apos;s the matter ? 
what &apos;s the rule about getting up in the middle of the night ? 
i think it &apos;s contaminated . 
not english though .  you heard the voices right uncle merrill ? 
the same windows . 
does it hurt ? 
 .  .  . tell morgan to play games  -  -  it &apos;s okay to be silly . 
this guy got on the roof in like a second . 
that roof is over ten feet high . 
how can you say that ? 
for the kids protection .  all they were doing was watching tv from five a . m .  i felt like they were getting obsessed like you said .  they should be playing furry ,  furry rabbit or tea party or something right ? 
where are you going ? 
i &apos;m sorry ,  what book is this ? 
graham . 
can i use bo &apos;s old baby monitor as a walkie - talkie ? 
it &apos;s still making the noises .  it &apos;s broken . 
dr .  bimboo ,  one of the authors of the book  -  - 
did someone save me ? 
you can &apos;t describe him at all ?  don &apos;t you think that &apos;s find of odd ? 
is anything missing ? 
some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world .   nothing really bad is going to happen ,  is it uncle merrill ? 
i wouldn &apos;t do that .  you &apos;re going to need every gun when that posse gets here . 
i &apos;d get down if i were you .  they may be up there now . 
if we charge them ,  they won &apos;t have a chance .  but we gotta get to the horses . 
all i did was kiss a girl . 
 .  .  . gotta go .  .  . 
where are we ? 
i &apos;d be worse if you hadn &apos;t come along . 
i almost didn &apos;t . 
you came all the way out here to tell me you &apos;re going to california ?  all you had to do was go ,  and we &apos;d never see each other again . 
you must have known that before you came . 
i &apos;m just meeting a guy here and moving on .  so far i haven &apos;t been able to find him . 
south of here ,  past chimayo . 
shame about the kid .  seems a lively sort . 
where you been ? 
daddy ? 
you own this land . 
never will again . 
because they don &apos;t like what i want . 
j . t .  &apos;s done everything he can .  i married a brave man .  augie ,  take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we &apos;re talking .   mckendrick picked the new sheriff himself ,  so j . t .  can &apos;t even get the law enforced . 
sure we are .  we &apos;re leaving at dawn . 
where &apos;s your brother ? 
this a friend of yours ? 
that &apos;s what you said in turley .  you remember how that ended . 
kelly ,  get over here .   you didn &apos;t come all this way just to pay me back that money ,  did you ?   kelly ,  meet my friend paden . 
there are three strangers in this room ,  traveller ,  and these gents you are accusing aren &apos;t them .   are these your friends ? 
i got there just short of too late . 
i see you &apos;re prospering without me . 
what is it you want from me ? 
nifty . 
i &apos;ll drink to that .  will you join me ,  miss  -  - 
and i know what i &apos;m talking about . 
yeah ,  aside from being a loud - mouthed ,  lying cheat ,  he &apos;s just the man i would have picked . 
is this a fair mix ? 
how about you ? 
i can &apos;t imagine how you ever let a man like that go .   i owe viktor everything . 
god ,  viktor .   why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself ? 
 -  -  it &apos;s called a projector . 
i &apos;m not taking away your daughter ,  just your deal .   you and i both know ,  after the divorce i kept you on for old time &apos;s sake ,  so you could still hold your head up in front of lainey .   i called what &apos;s his name at warner &apos;s .   he said he &apos;d take a meeting  -  -  in july .   i &apos;ve fought for you viktor .  .  .   you want to talk severance ? 
viktor .  .  .  i want to thank you for convincing simone to sign with the studio . 
viktor ,  it &apos;s my studio . 
sorry i didn &apos;t get her back in time . 
al least a contingency for wardrobe .   any woman can go up a dress size . 
i should fire you more often .   the film &apos;s looking wonderful . 
i &apos;ll tell you what .   i know how much this means to you .   i &apos;ll try to get her to plug the film .   i &apos;m not promising anything but maybe she &apos;ll do a talk show  -  -  taped . 
she was there .   she didn &apos;t by any chance happen to mention me ? 
i &apos;d love to .   but aren &apos;t you supposed to meet up with simone ? 
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll keep her focussed .  she &apos;s lucky to have you ,  viktor .   is she really having your baby ? 
that &apos;s sweet ,  viktor ,  but i couldn &apos;t let you do that  -  -  make that kind of sacrifice .   it &apos;s strange .   i &apos;ve stabbed people in the back ,  clawed and slept my way to where i am  -  -  it goes with the territory  -  -  but ,  for some reason ,  i can &apos;t betray simone .  there &apos;s .  .  .  i don &apos;t know any other way to say it  -  -  there &apos;s a goodness to her . 
what ?  .  .  .  what did you say ? 
simone ? 
well ,  no one could accuse you of being over - exposed ,  simone .   why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight ? 
nudity has just never been an issue for me ,  frank .   for me ,  clothes are just an option . 
that &apos;s true .   i can reveal that i am considering a career in politics . 
nicola anders is the only actress who can play that role . 
and still the connection was undeniable .   i haven &apos;t read  &quot; eternity forever &quot;  but i know it &apos;s brilliant .   and i know i would be perfect for clive . 
there &apos;s .  .  .  a wall between you  -  - 
you know i sometimes forget she has bodily functions . 
 -  -  eight years ago .   in that whole time ,  i never left my computer . 
that &apos;s why you &apos;re so perfect .   you have something i don &apos;t have . 
i &apos;ve seen every frame of your work .  you &apos;re the only filmmaker in hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision .  you and me ,  art and science .  .  .  we are the perfect marriage . 
do i hear the sound of .  .  .  wedding bells ? 
i &apos;m sorry mom canned you . 
dad ,  you know i don &apos;t like to get between you and mom but she &apos;s feeling down right now .   she broke up with kent . 
too impersonal .   they have to meet face - to - face . 
 -  -  no !   i can &apos;t go along with this horseshit !   just tell them they can fry me ! 
the cops ?   the cops read my column to know who to bust .   we &apos;re the only watchdog the public has .   none of this is going away .   we &apos;ll be here tomorrow and the day after that .   until you slip up .   and you will .   you are looking at your shadow .   because all these elaborate precautions with simone  -  -  every instinct in my body tells me ,  it &apos;s not natural . 
what is it exactly you want ,  sayer ? 
mr .  sayer ,  did we pay the million bucks yet ? 
 -  -  nicola !   how was your massage ? 
i beg you .   you can &apos;t do this to me . 
you know you &apos;re really very good .  i take back what i said .   i mean ,  you &apos;re really good . 
good morning ,  simone . 
you &apos;re going to get in a lot of trouble ,  mr .  taransky . 
i just needed to do a couple of things .   and i needed to tell you something . 
you want to ask me a question ? 
know what ? 
that isn &apos;t magic . 
once upon a time there was a prince ,  who was being driven around .  .  .  he drove around for a long ,  long time .  .  .  driving and driving .  .  .  it was a long trip .  .  .  he fell asleep .  .  .   when he woke up ,  they were still driving .  .  .  the long drive went on -  - 
no . 
did you think the play sucked big time ? 
can i ask you then ? 
what do you want more than anything ? 
are you wigging out ? 
we &apos;re not gonna start crying again ,  are we ? 
it &apos;s spanish .  it means .  .  .   &apos;i don &apos;t want to die .  &apos;  not all the ghosts are scary ,  are they ?  like mrs .  marschal ? 
what if they don &apos;t want help ?  what if they &apos;re just angry and they want to hurt somebody ? 
you didn &apos;t take it before .  you didn &apos;t take it the time after that .  and now ,  you didn &apos;t take it again ? 
a lady .  she died . 
stuttering -  -

i work at an insurance place and at penny &apos;s ,  so cole can go to that good school . 
fuck you !  if you &apos;re such an expert on music ,  why don &apos;t you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song ? 
looks like the alternator . 
damn !  these are one hundred dollar nikes ! 
the ancient aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was . 
yeah ,  man .  you were wrong ,  suze .  my solo definitely works better in the second verse . 
carl !  oh carrrrl !

how .  .  .  was she  &quot; called ?  &quot; 
was .  you ain &apos;t afraid of ghosts ,  now are you ? 
i wouldn &apos;t pay jesse no mind at all .  she &apos;s just a crazy old woman .  hasn &apos;t been right in the head since her husband passed away .   wasn &apos;t much right before that ,  neither . 
it &apos;s time to make amends . 
think boy .  that night .  the night of the fire .  at the barn .  you were only six years old . 
asphyxiation .  choked to death on a ham sandwich .  next .

like your guitar break . 
what ? 
and that makes you look like a squid ? 
was always curious why you .  .  .  married grant in the first place .  .  .  just never seemed outta love . 
grant used to get filled up every day .  i knew it was just to see me .  he was too old  -  -  but he was handsome .  and he had that big ol &apos; lincoln then .  i flirted with him . 
that wasn &apos;t a good night ,  no . 
it &apos;s my nature . 
where are you ?  ! 
when i buy my zoo ,  i &apos;m leaving them things the hell out !

you know ,  my mother was a dancer ,  too .  her big shot was the touring company of  &apos;brigadoon .  &apos; she &apos;s been married three times .  to a redneck ,  a poet and her tennis instructor .   see ,  i motor - mouth when i get nervous .  i was nervous when i first got into the car .  now i &apos;m scared shitless . 
mississippi &apos;s the other way ! 
 -  -  actually ,  my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named ramblin &apos; bobby holt .  when i turned twenty -  one ,  i went to europe with visions of being free and independent .  my luck ,  he was on the plane .  i landed in paris and fell in love before i could claim my baggage .   we were together for almost a year .  i thought he was it . 
they should arrest people for obeying the speed limit .

no . 
but there were more of you ?

 .  .  . holy shit .  .  .  that &apos;s heller .  .  .   isn &apos;t it ? 
i wouldn &apos;t go that far . 
i &apos;ll overlook what you &apos;ve done here today in light of what &apos;s taken place .  you &apos;ve been fully debriefed .  now i want you to return to d . c .  immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter .  i mean it .  it &apos;s closed . 
lil &apos; cagey ,  y &apos;know ,  don &apos;t like t &apos;share trade secrets ,  that type &apos;a thing .

i don &apos;t know ! 
forty - five apiece for you two ,  ten percent finders fee for me . 
you &apos;re being tricked .   sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors .   he &apos;s figured out they &apos;re made of subatomic particles called neutrinos ,  and he &apos;s going to create a negative neutrino field .   twenty four hours a day ,  until they &apos;re back on earth . 
where &apos;s his body ? 
they shouldn &apos;t let people like you into space . 
it &apos;s changing characteristics .   it &apos;s solidifying taking on weight . 
what &apos;s wrong ?   what happened to gibarian ? 
gibarian warned me .   he left me a message . 
i &apos;m not sure .   it started with gibarian .   he locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door .   he covered the video lens .  obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown .   i don &apos;t know why he didn &apos;t tell us he had somebody in there .   by this time ,  we were getting visitors ,  too .   he was desperately trying to figure it out .   day and night .   who was she ? 
she has materialized from your memory of her .   what was her name ? 
probably . 
kelvin ,  you awake ? 
you &apos;re unnerved because you &apos;ve spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you ,  and suddenly your subconscious is an open book .   we are ,  for the first time ,  experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own .   that proves that  -  - 
perhaps it did . 
they come when you sleep . 
she knows everything .   she knows who she is . 
kelvin ,  she &apos;ll disintegrate .   you don &apos;t believe me ?   let &apos;s radio that shuttle pod you launched  -  -  better yet ,  let &apos;s go get it .   i &apos;ve charted it &apos;s trajectory ,  only take a few hours .  .  . 
when did this happen ? 
i wasn &apos;t . 
and i just want to know if i &apos;m crazy or not  -  -  if what i think is happening is actually happening .   or am i one of those people ,  those women ,  who are blind to what &apos;s going on ?   who pretend not to see their husband &apos;s attention toward another woman ? 
scared .   no ,  not scared .   wary .  like i was something to be .  .  .  her guard went up .   i was a threat .   now i know why .   she was afraid she &apos;d be seen .   that i would see her for the self - obsessed neurotic that she was .  i think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal .  but that &apos;s the cycle ,  right ?   i knew a little more than she did ,  she knew a little more than her mother ,  and on and on .   i guess that &apos;s part of the reason why  -  - 
what happened to us ,  exactly ? 
i like that too . 
what does snow think you should do ? 
who have you been talking to ? 
do you want to stay here ?

what did he say ? 
are you nervous ? 
people think i &apos;m stepping out on neil .   we &apos;re causing quite a scandal . 
you all right ? 
i shouldn &apos;t have listened to you ,  i should &apos;ve followed you right into the  &quot; can &quot;  the way he did . 
he said he &apos;d kill me . 
you wouldn &apos;t happen to know what language they speak in india ,  do you ? 
so ,  this could be your last night ,  huh ? 
you mean to tell me ,  a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way ? 
no dog .

i &apos;m perfectly calm ,  i &apos;m a normal human being .   i &apos;m going for a walk in the park .

my wife talks to his wife about what shift i &apos;m gonna take ? 
i &apos;m going to visit my sister for a few days .   i &apos;d like you to get your stuff out . 
i don &apos;t know how you did it ,  but whatever it was ,  keep doing it .

this may be the end of a beautiful friendship ,  you know . 
lieutenant ,  i &apos;ve triangulated recent bizarre events -  -  the bronx ,  jersey ,  brooklyn -  -  all rippling out from -  -   here .   the e . s . u .  science center .  octavius &apos; experiment seems to have opened a hole in space - time ,  drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding ,  electromagnetism and gravity -  - 
yeah ,  roz . 
oh ,  ben gets through everything . 
in this obsolete little cyclotron ,  i &apos;m solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th century .   with more power ,  i could -  - 
that nobel prize will just have to wait . 
a bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory ,  the big bang ,  kaluza - klein -  - 
mr .  parker . 
need any more help ? 
why ?  it is a wrestling match ,  or
do you .  .  .  live around here ? 
professor ,  you ever fly one of these things before ? 
they never caught on . 
jawohl . 
jawohl ! 
maybe just a hint or so .  think hard . 
throws what ?  how could he have a time bomb ? 
w - w - will that do or do you want some m - m - m  -  -  ? 
i suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces ? 
what are you looking at him for ?   any objections ,  sefton ? 
the s . s .  men are here to pick up dunbar .  they &apos;re taking him to berlin .  looks like he &apos;s finished . 
lieutenant dunbar ?  it wouldn &apos;t be james schuyler dunbar ?  from boston ? 
what did you expect ,  glamor boy ?  the officers &apos; club with a steam room and a massage maybe ? 
nine - thirty .  general von pfeffinger should be at his desk by now .  shall we call berlin and tell him the good news ? 
what do you do for heat in this barrack ?  no stove ? 
aufstehen ,  gentlemen !  please !  you do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today ! 
jawohl ! 
wisecrackers ?  where did he pick up his english ?  in a pretzel factory ? 
when you get going on those broads ,  think of me ! 
good morning ,  animal !  what &apos;ll it be for breakfast ?  scrambled eggs with little sausages ?  bacon and eggs sunny -  side up ?  griddle cakes ?  a waffle ? 
you can say that again ! 
what d &apos;ya think ,  jerko !  you &apos;re the award ! 
easy ,  animal !  easy ! 
how ?  pinky miller from barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg ! 
hey !  this is with a typewriter !  it &apos;s from a finance company ! 
grable ,  not gable ! 
you &apos;re crying ,  animal . 
sergeant hoffman from barrack 4 . 
yes .  according to the geneva convention ,  dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial . 
 .  .  . a lieutenant james dunbar ?

no volunteers ,  price .  i said we &apos;re all in on it . 
los ,  los .  dummkopf ! 
anybody call ? 
you &apos;ll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you . 
who did ? 
you off your rocker ? 
you could use a new one yourself . 
i went to school with a guy named price .  but that was in boston .  you &apos;re from cleveland ,  aren &apos;t you . 
no .  i don &apos;t sprechen sie deutsch . 
will you get this guy out of my hair so i can go ? 
the what ? 
nun ?  was ist ?  haben sie &apos;s herausgefunden ? 
wie hat er &apos;s gemacht ? 
you should go and see the doctor .  maybe i can  -  -   silk stockings ? 
wunderbar !  maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife .  but there is a piano teacher in the village  -  - 
you &apos;d better talk ,  schulz ,  because i &apos;m going to find out with you or without you .  because i won &apos;t let go for a second .  because they &apos;ll have to kill me to stop me .  so talk ! 
my grandmother &apos;s ear - muffs . 
you must have been some tail gunner !   go ahead ,  cookie . 
you heard him . 
where is he now ? 
target their bridge . 
give me a list of those effects .  i want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed ,  no matter how insignificant . 
this is its current position . 
that &apos;s where he &apos;s going . 
approximately forty - seven minutes ,  sir . 
is she still angry ? 
but at the first sign of trouble ,  i &apos;m going to deactivate it .  agreed ? 
really ?  what do you feel ? 
looks like you &apos;re stuck with emotions for a while .  how do you feel ? 
could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak ? 
do you remember him ? 
can i ? 
well ,  may we have a look around ? 
yes .   thank you . 
oh
but i do have a theory .  .  . 
kirk here . 
oh ,  i forgot to tell you .  while you were unconscious ,  i injected a nano - probe into your bloodstream .  it &apos;s been navigating your cardiovascular system ,  and right now i &apos;ve attached it to your left ventricle .   a little trick i picked up from the borg . 
well ,  now that we &apos;re all aboard=8a  number one ,  bring the ship before the wind .   let &apos;s see what &apos;s out there . 
there &apos;s still no indication of why they attacked the station ? 
there is something else ,  captain .  one of the scientists ,  a doctor soran , has insisted on speaking with you .   i told him you were busy ,  sir ,  but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away . 
report . 
i always thought i &apos;d have a crack at this chair one day . 
well ,  with all due respect to your betazoid senses ,  i prefer to be alone right now . 
your family history is very important to you ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
nothing for me .   i understand there &apos;s something urgent you need to discuss with me . 
as their cloak begins to engage ,  their shields will drop . 
enterprise maintaining full impulse power .  .  . 
transwarp at your command ,  sir ! 
i &apos;d swear something was there sir ,  but i might have imagined it . 
nothing on my scanner ,  sir . 
captain ,  please  -  -  we &apos;ll take the risk .  we &apos;ve got< / u> to find out what it is .  .  . 
saavik to grissom .  request computer study of soil samples for geological aging . 
my readings indicate great instability . 
you mean ,  we &apos;re stranded down here ?  ! 
it &apos;s time for total truth between us .   this planet is not what you intended ,  or hoped for ,  is it ? 
protomatter .  an unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable . 
whoever they are ,  they &apos;re getting closer . 
saavik .  .  .  does dr .  marcus think there could be  -  -  any chance of  -  -  ah  -  -  radioactive contamination ? 
captain ,  what &apos;s happening ?  ! 
certainly ,  sir .  how else can i keep my reputation as a miracle worker ? 
steady .  .  .  steady .  .  .  all right ,  mr .  scott . 
mr .  scott ,  all power to the weapons systems  -  - 
mr .  scott :  two photon torpedoes at the ready .  sight on the center of the mass . 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
is there anything< / u> we can do ?  ! 
my father says you have been my friend .  .  .  you came back for me . 
 .  .  .  admiral ,  what &apos;s going to happen to enterprise ? 
klingon bird of prey ,  sir !  she &apos;s arming torpedoes .  .  .  ! 
mr .  sulu ,  what is the crew complement of a bird of prey ? 
gentlemen .  good evening . 
you &apos;re right .   thanks for the drink . 
give me what i want  -  -  and i &apos;ll consider it .  .  . 
yes .  exhilarating ,  isn &apos;t it ! 
but  -  -  why ? 
 .  .  .  he spoke of your friendship . 
bones !  .  .  . 
1 , 000 kellicams ,  closing ! 
my lord ,  enemy commander wishes a truce to confer . 
we still have the prisoners ,  sir .  perhaps their information  -  - 
but surely ,  our mission has not failed  -  -   ? 
not anymore !  now you can do both at the same time !  according to myth ,  the earth was created in six days .  watch out :  here comes genesis; we &apos;ll do it for you in six minutes  -  - 
uh  -  -  what are they ? 
say thank you . 
i &apos;ve got the sick bay ready .  will someone please tell me what is going on ? 
now that &apos;s what i call a meal . 
it is a far far better thing i do than i have ever done before .  .  .  a far better resting place i go to than i have ever known .  .  . 
come on ,  mother ,  that &apos;s just the military mentality .  never put off tomorrow what you can put off today .  if there &apos;s one atom of life .  .  . 
well ,  don &apos;t have kittens .  genesis is going to work .  they &apos;ll remember  you in a wreath with newton ,  einstein ,  surak .  .  . 
this ?  it took the starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this .  what we did in there  -  -  we did in a day .  david ,  why don &apos;t you show dr .  mccoy and the lieutenant our idea of food . 
all right ,  let &apos;s get on the comm - pic to doctor marcus .  maybe it &apos;s something we can transplant . 
a criminal ,  captain  -  -  a product of the late 20th century genetic engineering  -  - 
you still remember ,  admiral .  i cannot help but be touched .  of course ,  i remember you . 
genesis ,  what &apos;s that ? 
we &apos;ll be going to warp speed  -  - 
just barely ,  sir . 
enterprise to reliant .  come in ,  reliant . 
mr .  scott on discrete . 
why< / u> ? 
your first training voyage ,  mr .  preston ? 
i believe you &apos;ll find everything shipshape ,  admiral . 
have they proceeded with their experiments ? 
not enough against their shields . 
you &apos;ve got to learn why things work on a starship .   it &apos;s coming through now ,  khan .  .  . 
regula is class  &quot; d &apos; .  it consists of various remarkable ores .  essentially ,  a great rock in space . 
that &apos;s it ? 
admiral ,  they &apos;re reducing speed . 
sporadic energy readings port side ,  aft .  could be an impulse turn . 
kirk here . 
yes . 
saavik ,  get us out ,  best speed ! 
stop engines . 
mr .  sulu .  .  .  the shields ! 
i can &apos;t get power ,  sir ! 
leaving section fourteen for section fifteen . 
humans make illogical decisions .  .  . 
bones ,  stay here . 
sure ,  slingshot around the sun .  if you pick up enough speed you &apos;re in time warp .  if you don &apos;t ,  you fry .  . 
congratulations ,  jim .  i think you &apos;ve saved the earth . 
you mean i have to die to discuss your insights on death ? 
shields ,  mr .  chekov . 
they &apos;re gonna hafta take their chances . 
he &apos;s just going to hang around the bushes while we eat ? 
how will that be done ,  exactly ? 
what &apos;s that ? 
well ,   &quot; admiral ,  &quot;  that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story i &apos;ve ever heard . 
i bet you &apos;re a damn good poker player . 
 .  .  .  gone ?  ! 
what kind of spaceship is this ,  anyway ? 
if we keep going up ,  they &apos;ll catch us ! 
all i need is the radio frequency to track them . 
i have no time to argue ,  gillian .  or even tell you how much you &apos;ve meant to us .  .  .  the frequency< / u> . 
you tricked me . 
thank you ,  admiral . 
spock .  .  .  ? 
that leaves us no choice .  we must destroy the probe before it destroys earth . 
about those colorful metaphors we discussed .  i don &apos;t think you should try to use them . 
and another thing .  .  .  it is not always necessary to tell the truth . 
i meant  -  - 
hang on ,  sir .  .  .  nine point seven .  .  .  point eight .  .  .  breakaway threshold .  .  . 
aye ,  sir .  descending . 
maintaining impulse climb .  wing five by zero ,  helm steady . 
10 , 000 m . s . l .  ,  admiral . 
sir  -  -  i &apos;ve got some back pressure on manual  -  - 
then ,  this is what it would sound like underwater ? 
bearing ! 
mr .  scott ,  how soon can we get underway ? 
scotty ,  we have to find some humpbacks . 
you &apos;ll work it out ,  scotty .  and remember :  two of them . 
they &apos;re giving out .  de - crystallizing . 
i &apos;m ready spock .  let &apos;s go find george and gracie .  .  . 
stand by ,  sir .  miracle worker at work .  .  . 
admiral ,  i &apos;d like to continue my work on the ship until you leave . 
don &apos;t know anything about it ?  i find it difficult to believe that i &apos;ve come millions of miles  -  - 
professor scott ,  if you &apos;ll  -  - 
ah ,  what else indeed ?  let me put it another way :  how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18 , 000 cubic feet of water ? 
transparent aluminum ? 
there are days . 
an apprentice for thirty years .   we &apos;ve noticed your people &apos;s mental discipline .  did that develop here ? 
jak &apos;tahla ? 
there &apos;s a cavern at the base of the next hill .  .  . 
do you really think your mighty federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people ? 
i know why .   so people like us won &apos;t be afraid of you any more . 
because you &apos;re it .  and if you tag me .  .  .  then i &apos;m it . 
no .  .  .  i want to stay with you .  .  . 
can he breathe under water ? 
they all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production .  .  .  probably the result of the environmental anomalies here .  .  . 
you either need a new uniform or a new neck . 
she &apos;s stabilizing . 
hello ,  data .  .  . 
yes .  .  .  that looks like them . 
 &apos;his nose should pant and his lip should curl .  .  .  &apos;
i believe the boy is .  .  .  afraid .  .  .  of me . 
how many ? 
your federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be .  .  . 
take us into a high orbit .   lie down ,  admiral .  the girls will take twenty years off your face .  .  . 
your self - restraint puzzles me ,  admiral .  you continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer .  .  . 
i &apos;ll order riker to turn around . 
captain ,  i wasn &apos;t expecting you . 
right .  we have the planet and they have the technology  -  -  a technology we can &apos;t duplicate .  you know what that makes us ?  their partners . 
it would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition .  some of them won &apos;t survive that long .  besides ,  they don &apos;t want to live in the middle of the briar patch .  .  .  who would ? 
order them to surrender ,  and i promise you won &apos;t be court -  martialed . 
a coward .  .  .  without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity .  you offend me . 
moving them is one thing .  killing them all .  .  . 
i took these out of data &apos;s neural net .  .  .  they contain memory engrams .  .  . 
if we don &apos;t outrun them ,  the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship . 
will that stop the tear ? 
we &apos;re pulling it like a zipper across space .  .  . 
i thought subspace weapons were banned by the khitomer accord .  .  . 
they &apos;re powering their forward weapons array . 
 &apos;yew - cheen chef - faw .  &apos;
nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey .  .  . 
we came here from a solar system on the verge of self -  annihilation .  .  .  where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life .  a small group of us set off to find a new home .  .  .  a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds .   that was three hundred and nine years ago . 
sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface .  .  . 
he might be using the planet &apos;s rings to mask his approach . 
do you know gilbert and sullivan ? 
the damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire ! 
the ba &apos;ku could use some rest ,  sir .  according to the geo - scan ,  this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers .  .  . 
one .  it &apos;s ru &apos;afo . 
what you &apos;re doing to my neck .  .  . 
both .   i think i &apos;m having a mid - life crisis .  .  . 
 .  .  .  i &apos;m not sleeping well .  .  . 
what i need ,  i can &apos;t get from doctor crusher .  .  .   counselor ,  do you think it &apos;s possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they &apos;ve made ? 
the new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick ,  jean - luc .  we &apos;ve destroyed forty - seven borg ships so far .  .  .  and only lost fifteen of our own .   but one of the borg ships has broken through our defenses ,  and it &apos;s heading directly for earth .  can you handle it ? 
admiral .  .  .  what &apos;s the status of the borg fleet ? 
you are the guiding intelligence behind the borg .  .  .  ? 
isn &apos;t it better like this .  .  .  ? 
no .  .  .  no ,  it &apos;s so .  .  .  empty .  .  .  please .  .  .  give it back .  .  .  i need it .  .  . 
but now .  .  .  they are all one with the borg . 
who are you ? 
the planet &apos;s surface is covered with borg technology .   so is the moon .  .  .  and three other planets in this solar system . 
juice ? 
where ? 
captain ,  i &apos;m starting to worry about the hull integrity .  we &apos;ve been running the support field at full power for three hours straight .  i don &apos;t know how much longer it &apos;s going to hold up . 
this must be it . 
i &apos;m picking up faint life signs twenty meters below . 
maybe .  .  .   sure .  yeah .  as long as i could get a clear look at the intake configuration .  but so far ,  we haven &apos;t found any other photos . 
the nacelles are charged .  .  .  nuclear warhead standing by .  we &apos;re ready to ignite the warp drive . 
the inertial dampers are having trouble compensating .  .  .  i don &apos;t think cochrane built this thing for comfort . 
captain ,  the enterprise ! 
what about our warp signature ?  it has to be strong enough for them to detect . 
you seem to have an answer for everything . 
did you need something ? 
bed sheets .   i used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints .  not the best material ,  but i haven &apos;t seen a clean piece of paper in five years . 
i &apos;d say you already have . 
why are you being so difficult ?  all i &apos;m asking for is to look at one of the photographs .  it &apos;ll take five minutes . 
captain .  .  .  ? 
time travel .  .  .  they &apos;re attempting time travel .  .  .   full power ,  mister data .  worf ,  quantum torpedoes at my command ! 
incoming transmission from starfleet command .  admiral hayes . 
casualties are light ,  captain .  minor buckling on the port nacelle .  nothing serious . 
i have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems .  so far ,  they &apos;ve had no success . 
you will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo .  .  .  and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation .   there &apos;s only one torpedo left .  .  . 
report ! 
emergency override ! 
worf ?  is something wrong ? 
mr .  president . 
pity they &apos;re retiring us just as i was starting to understand you ,  spock .  .  . 
what kind of creature is this ?  last night you two were spooning  - 
too bad we can &apos;t smell her . 
they don &apos;t arrest people for having feelings . 
are you carrying a surgeon ? 
retire . 
i was nervous  - 
my god ,  what happened here ? 
what ? 
and you still maintain your ship did not fire on kronos one ?  would you have known if she had ?  come now ,  captain .  the record clearly there were no other ships in the sector . 
you deny enterprise fired on kronos one ? 
you deny that your men beamed aboard kronos one and shot the chancellor ? 
captain ,  if they fire at us with our shields down  -  - 
course heading ,  captain ? 
your friends are late .  .  . 
and your coat . 
we don &apos;t get many presidential assassins . 
that &apos;s not his knee .   not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place ,  captain . 
when whoever it is makes their move ,  you won &apos;t be here to ask if he &apos;s the one . 
uhura ,  hailing frequencies .  right standard rudder ,  bring us alongside .  .  . 
captain ,  our shields  -  -   ! 
this is captain sulu ,  uss excelsior . 
surely not . 
me ? 
i have personally vouched for you in this matter ,  captain . 
how could you vouch for me ?  that &apos;s .  .  .    .  .  .  arrogant presumption  - 
i don &apos;t believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy .  .  . 
captain .  .  . 
can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness ?   would that constitute a joke ? 
but i am not human .  i am only  - 
what &apos;s she waiting for ? 
the only way to find out if a man &apos;s trustworthy .  .  . 
how did you  -   ? 
any reply from starfleet to our dispatch ,  lieutenant . 
any progress ? 
in nineteenth century france ,  workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines ,  flung their wooden shoes  -  called sabots  -  into the gears to stop them .  hence the word sabotage . 
apparently they &apos;re refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock ,  sir . 
according to this we &apos;ve completed our exploration of the entire sector . 
a computer canna lie ,  sir . 
they dinna fire on themselves .  and there were no other ships present . 
 -  could take weeks ,  sir . 
they &apos;re outside the beaming shield .  mr .  scott ,  start your engines . 
they might as well arrest me ,  too; i felt like lieutenant saavik . 
can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you ? 
i do not understand . 
it has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level .  i can &apos;t overestimate the danger of thalaron radiation ,  jean luc .  a microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds . 
he was a damn fool .  selfish and ambitious .  very much in need of seasoning . 
and this makes you  &quot; sad &quot;  ? 
data ! 
my mission was a success ,  sir .  i have discovered the source of the thalaron radiation . 
a bit less florid ,  data . 
sir ,  allow me to go .  you are needed here . 
at present he serves no useful function .  dr .  soong created us to become active and useful members of society .  i do not believe he would have wanted the b - 9 to live out his life in his present state . 
captain picard agrees that the b - 9 was probably designed with the same self - actualization parameters as myself .  if my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix ,  he should have all my abilities . 
what purpose does this serve ? 
dr .  soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions . 
it &apos;s you . 
no . 
if you wouldn &apos;t mind . 
i &apos;m afraid that drink will have to wait ,  captain . 
that &apos;s what i don &apos;t get  -  -  it &apos;s mostly basic stellar cartography :  star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations .  it &apos;s not even restricted material . 
geordi ,  put 211 power to the engines .   take it from life support if you have to  -  -  everything you can give me . 
 believe me ,  we don &apos;t under -  stand it either .  you &apos;re the closest ship so i want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say .  get the lay of the land ,  if the empire becomes unstable ,  it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant . 
i won &apos;t do it . 
captain .  i think it is inappropriate for a starfleet officer to appear .  .  .   naked . 
tactical analysis ,  mister worf . 
coordinate our attack with the valdore &apos;s tactical officer .  triangulate fire on any shield impacts . 
diverting to the kolarin system takes us awfully close to the romulan neutral zone . 
captain ,  with all due respect to diplomatic protocols   -  -  the federation council &apos;s not sitting out here ,  we are . 
counselor troi ,  report to the bridge . 
the titan &apos;s a fine ship ,  will .  and she &apos;s getting a captain worthy of her . 
but she &apos;s not the enterprise . 
i hope you &apos;ll forgive the darkness .  .  .  we &apos;re not comfortable in the light . 
on the world i come from there &apos;s no light .  no sun .  beauty isn &apos;t important .  i see now there &apos;s a world elsewhere . 
i want to end the centuries of mistrust .  i want to be your ally ,  not your enemy .  as a first step i propose we eliminate the neutral zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas . 
and when i was ready they were going to replace you with me ,  an exact biological duplicate .  put a romulan agent at the heart of starfleet to . influence your command structure .  it was a bold plan . 
for thousands of years the romulan senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister - planet .  .  .  but the time has come for us to live as equals . 
i know you as well as i know myself ,  shinzon .  there was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be . 
praetor ,  we &apos;ve received the transponder signal . 
our greater goal is more important ,  brother . 
well ,  that sounds relaxing too . 
believe it or not ,  i think the cavalry has arrived . 
are we prepared ? 
it &apos;s accelerating .  you have no more time for games . 
let her pursue  -  -  drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop . 
join us ,  commanders .   now what &apos;s the disposition of the fleet ? 
then i don &apos;t understand the reason for the delay ! 
and bringing the enterprise here ?  !  what possible purpose could that serve ? 
the enterprise is immaterial !  they won &apos;t make it back to federation space . 
don &apos;t you think you should call a backup ? 
you have one with two beds ? 
credit card . 
we &apos;re only going to be here a few hours .  .  . 
hey ,  that sounds interesting .  you like it ? 
do you have children ? 
what do you think of america ? 
no !  !  !  no !  !  ! 
where did you stop last ? 
where &apos;s that ? 
we &apos;re going .  .  .  damn !   we &apos;ll tell the press that there was an accident .  chemical warfare spill .  that cover cannot be violated in any way .  understand me ,  shermin ? 
houston found it in the extraterrestrial &apos;s suit . 
clarify that . 
you sure you want this ,  because .  .  .  that &apos;s putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over .  .  . 
you can change a directive ,  george .  you &apos;ve done it before .  listen to me .  he &apos;s going somewhere in death valley .  lathrop wells was never anything but a bus stop .  east is the nuclear site .  there are no roads in there .  she was teaching him to hitchhike .  i &apos;m telling you .  we block the four roads into death valley and we got him . 
that &apos;s the chance we have to take . 
i won &apos;t let anyone hurt you . 
what ? 
minneapolis .  .  .  good . 
i am husband ? 
no ,  no .  .  .  don &apos;t say that .  bad word . 
why are you going here ?  what is here ? 
i &apos;d love to have a baby .  but i can &apos;t .  .  . 
but i must go here . 
say it . 
jennyhaydn . 
the captain .  .  . 
sounds like your captain &apos;s going to get hell when he gets back home . 
yes . 
why can &apos;t we wait here for a ride ? 
asshole !  ! 
we &apos;re not going to get a ride tonight . 
let &apos;s find a place out of the rain .  i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll get a ride in the morning . 
you are cold . 
what ? 
hello .  .  .  hello .  how are you this morning ? 
no ,  they don &apos;t talk .  .  .  we talk to them . 
the cowboys were right .  you can make money fast gambling . 
this is crazy .  we don &apos;t have time for this . 
you won ten dollars .  big deal .  if we don &apos;t get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship . 
i don &apos;t need any money for the baby .  i &apos;ll be fine . 
this is yours .  .  . 
the yellow one . 
tell the baby about me . 
they after you ? 
why wouldn &apos;t he want to go through the roadblock ?  .  .  .  what did you guys do ?  .  .  .  i won &apos;t tell anybody . 
no ,  sir .  radar . 
after i called in ,  i had a chance to sit down with the three locals .  they swear there &apos;s another one that didn &apos;t make the ship .  .  .  it might be alive . 
nothing up there .  .  .  the grass is matted down in a few places ,  but that could have been anything . 
i don &apos;t understand . 
lenny the loser .   panhandler of stolen dreams . 
i made my choice ,  lenny . 
you said you were going to get her out of this . 
he doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .  leave him alone . 
this piece of puke hired me to kill you ,  baby .   do you believe that ?  isn &apos;t that right ,  tran ?   you pinhead . 
look ,  baby ,  it &apos;s now of never .  .  .  the guy is a known input junkie ,  so a little od won &apos;t surprise anybody .  it &apos;s the only way we can be together .   you know it &apos;s true . 
and then she said ,   &apos;since we &apos;re going to be spending so much time together -  -  &apos;
hey ,  you going to watch or you going to do ? 
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea ,  lenny . 
faith ,  call me ,  okay ? 
you &apos;re crazier than i thought ,  lenny .   coming here .  .  .  tran &apos;s just in there . 
how did it happen ?   what was iris doing riding around with jeriko wearing a wire ? 
so finally he gives iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do . 
i understand .   no ,  i &apos;m not . 
what ?   right here ? 
come on ,  amigo ,  the world &apos;s full of marks .   and nobody knows how to work  &apos;em like you do ,  pal .   you could sell a goddamn rat &apos;s asshole for a wedding ring !   let me buy you a drink . 
sounds like tick &apos;s already celebrating . 
he &apos;s been cooked - off
you just did . 
how did you hook up with faith ? 
tick .   not to dash your hopes ,  but i don &apos;t deal this kind of product ,  you know that .   i &apos;ll give you four for it ,  cause i &apos;ve gotta cut off the last bit .   and my customers want uncut . 
give me six at least .   this &apos;s a good clip ,  here .   gets you pumpin &apos; . 
whoa .   that is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck . 
iris ,  man .   pay attention . 
i always do . 
nero . 
greetings ,  gents .   so let &apos;s hear this week &apos;s sad story . 
come on ,  mace .   this is gonna be a big night .   can &apos;t you feel it ?   the energy in the air ?   there &apos;s money to be made ,  dreams to sell . 
price he pays for being a scumsucking pig . 
are we having a bad night ? 
so am i .   just trying to get by . 
my god ,  lenny .   what is it ? 
cause you &apos;re the man ,  right ?   the magic man .   if it &apos;s got something to do with the wire ,  sooner or later it washes up on your beach . 
see ,  it &apos;s all about what they see walking in .   a dead hooker ,  handcuffs ,  penetration .  .  .  they &apos;ll see a trick gone wrong .   random kill .   the kind you never solve . 
whatup lenny ? 
lenny ,  give them the tape . 
bullet resistant ?   whatever happened to bullet proof ? 
i &apos;ve got a good idea ,  yeah . 
it was a tough call . 
whatya mean ?   we &apos;re going !   tran &apos;s gonna do her right there unless -  - 
yeah .   lenny .   i have . 
mace .  .  .  you &apos;re a girl . 
but i mean isn &apos;t he faith &apos;s new -  -  
so you &apos;re saying we just pretend is didn &apos;t happen ?   it happened !   the lapd executed one of the most important black men in america !   who the fuck are you to bury this ?  ! 
besides that . 
no . 
does koessler know about the suspect zero theory ? 
oh jesus ,  sheriff ,  i am sorry .  i meant to call you  -  -  i got distracted  -  -  the sumpter girl was not one of speck &apos;s victims .  that &apos;s the good news . 
show &apos;s over ,  boys .  nobody home . 
i want the autopsy report ,  where is it ,  minnesota ? 
the family has gone through a lot .  their daughter missing ,  the search ,  her body found ,  the funeral  -  -  then this order to exhume the corpse . 
the body was embalmed .  i don &apos;t understand  -  - 
ligature strangulation ,  just like his victims .  a cord ,  nylon ,  you can tell by the indentation signature  -  -  again ,  like his victims .   look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in .  should have cut it off . 
oh yes ,  i see .  you must get asked this a lot . 
i don &apos;t mean to be rude ,  but .  .  . 
what ? 
excuse me ? 
you have the photo from the diner ? 
deputy director ,  get out ,  sir . 
i think i talked to him . 
do you think he singled you out ? 
you didn &apos;t like anyone looking over your shoulder  -  -  why was that ?  what were you doing ? 
how do you send out an apb on a dead man ? 
watch out for dick low ,  he &apos;s a liar; he has his own world .  there was a junior agent in seattle ,  not unlike you ,  an agent who fell under dick &apos;s spell .  he &apos;d have done anything for agent low .  richard got this agent to take a suspect to the crime scene ,  beat him up ,  force a confession  -  -  all unauthorized ,  all illegal .   the agent died that night ,  killed by the suspect .  richard low got him killed .  worst of all ,  we had to hush it up ,  let the suspect go .  the suspect was george sheldon ,  the second man richard killed . 
we &apos;ll wait .  get online with low ,  inform him of zero &apos;s route  -  -  we &apos;ll set a trap for him . 
when i was at the rest stop ,  there was a young boy ,  maybe ten ,  and his mother .  darryl hawkins ,  zero ,  abducted the boy in the men &apos;s room .  i tried to stop him .  he cold - cocked me  -  - 
thanks for the ride . 
doesn &apos;t fit . 
some kids found you in a garbage dump . 
no ,  no ,  no ,  most of them  -  -  i used to think all of them  -  -  are just fantasists ,  guys who get off telling degrading stories .  when i came across this fugitive chat room ,  listened in ,  i started to think some might actually be real ,  that they &apos;d gone live .  the challenge was to figure out which was which .  then i had my disagreement with koessler . 
what &apos;s that ? 
i saw him on a talk show once ,  talking about these killers like they were his friends .  not the victims ,  not the families of the victims ,  he doesn &apos;t talk about them .  blood money ,  that &apos;s what it is .   did he hit on you ? 
you must really think i &apos;m a square ,  a computer nerd . 
why did koessler assign you as my liaison ? 
he &apos;s called a couple times . 
just routine stuff . 
you should have seen the store manager at parade of shoes .  she was inconsolable . 
it &apos;s okay to be wrong ,  just don &apos;t be dead wrong . 
i haven &apos;t changed anything .   damn . 
he couldn &apos;t break an egg with a hammer .  he still writing those crime porn books ? 
there &apos;s someone out there ,  mack ,  i know ,  some man killing for the fun of it ,  sniffing human glue ,  without regard to age or sex ,  without predicable m . o .  someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies .  you have access ,  you can call up local authorities ,  check morgues ,  conduct interviews .  be my man . 
 &#93 fantasy time ,  girls ,  give it up ,  give it up . ]
if i owe ,  i will go . 
 &quot; computer investigation and infrastructure assessment center .  &quot;  quantico out of mit  -  -  you &apos;re a techie ?   okay ,  you screwed up once .  so did half the guys here .  that &apos;s why they &apos;re here . 
headed there now .  the same shift will be on at noon . 
 &quot; mydick ?  &quot; 
how far is amarillo ? 
deputy director koessler doesn &apos;t want zero .  all he cares about is low . 
he &apos;s a brilliant man .  brilliant enough to catch you . 
how are you ladies doing this evening ? 
you like laughing at the misery of others ? 
well ,  thank you .  .  .  ? 
well ,  it wasn &apos;t the simple ,  but yeah . 
oh ,  god .  that &apos;s two more than me .  tell me it gets better . 
like what ? 
anything ? 
maybe it doesn &apos;t matter if he &apos;s a good dancer cause it &apos;s a slow song ,  if that &apos;s what he &apos;s afraid of . 
you want to come with us to a party at the chateau marmont ?  they got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies . 
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry .  how &apos;d your folks take it ? 
i know what you &apos;re saying ,  man .  i don &apos;t know what to tell you .  .  . 
oh my god .

listen to me ,  baby ,  there are going to be beautiful babies there . 
listen to you .  i got an audition for a pilot at nine and i &apos;m going .  you gotta get out with some beautiful babies .  you can &apos;t sit home thinking about her . 
i don &apos;t know ,  i don &apos;t know  -  -  listen to you .  we &apos;re gonna have fun tonight .  we gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment . 
you got it bad ,  baby .  you need vegas . 
what are you wearing ?  i mean ,  we should wear suits . 
no ,  seriously ,  if you &apos;re dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot ,  they give you free shit . 
that &apos;s not cool . 
don &apos;t make fun ,  i think we can get some free shit if we don &apos;t fuck around . 
double down . 
i &apos;m telling you ,  baby ,  you always double down on an eleven .

hey ,  man ,  i &apos;m down too ,  you know . 
i don &apos;t think so . 
i &apos;m too tired for this .  let &apos;s just go . 
i don &apos;t know .  .  . 
that &apos;s bullshit . 
that was so fuckin &apos; money .  it was like that  &quot; jedi mind &quot;  shit .

i was younger .  .  .  it was college .  you didn &apos;t go to college ,  you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like .  you screw chicks you have no business being with .  they &apos;re young ,  they don &apos;t know any better . 
no . 
you guys are such assholes . 
you looked right at her ,  baby . 
we got the digits ,  baby . 
tomorrow ? 
bitch .  .  .  you little bitch ! 
it &apos;s on . 
 .  .  . but it &apos;s worth the risk .  true or false :  it &apos;s worth the risk . 
 .  .  . we &apos;re not .  .  . 
 .  .  . shivering .  .  . 
 .  .  . you &apos;re just poking at it .  .  . 
laugh all you want ,  but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who &apos;s ready to party . 
it &apos;s on .  .  . 
anything .  .  . anything the godfather wishes . 
this is tom hagen; i &apos;m calling for don corleone ,  at his request . 
you fingered sonny for the barzini people .   that little farce you played out with my sister .   did barzini kid you that would fool a corleone ? 
what &apos;s the matter ,  carlo ? 
what was that ? 
eat it ,  it &apos;s on the table . 
paulie &apos;s been a little sick all winter .  .  . he was home . 
he &apos;s going to be our lawyer in vegas .   nobody goes to him with any other business as of now ,  this minute .   no reflection on tom; that &apos;s the way i want it .   besides ,  if i ever need any advice ,  who &apos;s a better consigliere than my father . 
no . 
tom ,  i never thought you were a bad consigliere ,  i thought santino a bad don ,  rest in peace .   he had a good heart but he wasn &apos;t the right man to head the family when i had my misfortune .   michael has all my confidence ,  as you do .   for reasons which you can &apos;t know ,  you must have no part in what will happen . 
will your girl friend get back to the city all right ? 
no ,  i wanted other things for you . 
don tommassino . 
things went badly in palermo ? 
what is it ? 
you tell us about america . 
we hear .   we were told you were a pezzonovanta .  .  . big shot . 
why didn &apos;t moe green meet us at the airport ? 
mike ,  you sure about moe selling .  he never mentioned it to me and he loves the business . 
is the hospital covered ? 
what about luca ?   sollozzo didn &apos;t seem worried about luca .   that worries me . 
no more stalemate tom ,  we got the soldiers ,  we &apos;ll match them gun for gun if that &apos;s how they want it .  they know me for what i am ,  tom -  -  and they &apos;re scared of me . 
mike ,  why am i out ? 
why do they bother him on a day like this ? 
once upon a time ,  about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father &apos;s olive oil business .   they had al capone send some men in from chicago to kill my father ,  and they almost did . 
tom .  .  . tom ,  i &apos;d like you to meet kay adams . 
if he &apos;s your brother ,  why does he have a different name ?

truck drivers bring up harlem specials that blow up in your hand .  but this guy don &apos;t deal no shit .  just quality .  if you ever need anything ,  i can put you in touch .

i &apos;m sorry . 
no .  .  .  you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before .  .  . 
you know ,  everyone &apos;s so excited about the bijou re - opening .  .  . 
it never used to be .   you were two left feet on the dance floor .   like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step . 
sir ,  are you referring to the fact that i was suffering from amnesia ,  and i &apos;ve since recovered my memory ? 
well ,  i &apos;d direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty - six of the document ,  and the name printed and signed there .

exactly how long has the bijou been closed ? 
they couldn &apos;t wait to see you . 
this is the staff of the bijou . 
forty - two was a lean year around here .   the war had just started .  .  .  you were gone less than a month .  .  .  and we were coming off a bit of a drought as i recall .   not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket ,  and a chicken &apos;s as good as money if you ask me .   at that time ,  it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures . 
why don &apos;t you two get out there and dance ? 
luke .  .  .  what time is it ? 
did i what ? 
you tight with j .  edgar hoover ? 
you know i &apos;m not a communist ,  don &apos;t you ,  jer ? 
gimmee her number ,  i &apos;ll have her pick you up .

any idea how you got here ,  son ? 
what is it ? 
you should watch what you say . 
fought ?   come on ,  pete ,  you ran the px at fort dix . 
you broke your arm .   you were coming out of a bar .   you were drunk . 
they don &apos;t want you to testify because you &apos;re not a big enough fish for them .   they just don &apos;t want you writing pictures for now .  that &apos;s all . 
exactly . 
that was quite a show you gave them today .   we shoulda sold tickets . 
why not ? 
luke !   luke ,  something &apos;s wrong !  the film broke ,  and i can &apos;t raise harry on the house phone !

did you think i didn &apos;t kn - kn - know that ? 
ernie cole here just got himself elected mayor .   lost both his boys in the war .   kenny at anzio and willie at normandy . 
mr .  appleton ,  i have reason to believe you &apos;re holding something back ,  and that just rubs me the wrong way .   sir ,  are you a communist ? 
yes ? 
i &apos;ve been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes ,  but i couldn &apos;t convince myself to stop .  this  &apos;tilling of the soil &apos; can get a little compulsive ,  you know . 
do i ?   no ,  i &apos;m an open book ,  i &apos;m afraid .   or maybe a closed one .   pretty .  what are they ? 
hi .   is something wrong ?  is that cut beginning to bother you ? 
and what had you done ? 
annie ,  that adds up to a jealous ,  possessive woman . 
mother ! 
yeah ,  but she &apos;ll be hitting all that traffic going back to san francisco . 
mitch ?   do .  .  .  do you think they &apos;ll be all right ?  in the trunk ?  can they breath ? 
lois ! 
where does he live ? 
the two kids ?

i didn &apos;t want to come right down the road ,  where they could see me . 
of course . 
daniels . 
gulls ! 
across at brinkmeyer &apos;s . 
he sold the feed to me ,  didn &apos;t he ? 
she &apos;s a charming girl ,  isn &apos;t she ,  mitch ? 
but she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way .  .  . 
did you you get the windows in the attic ,  mitch ? 
they won &apos;t be . 
then he saw . 
i miss him .   you know ,  sometimes i wake up in the morning ,  and i think  &apos;i have to make frank &apos;s breakfast ,  &apos; and i .  .  .  i get up and there &apos;s a .  .  .  a very good reason for getting out of bed until .  .  .  until ,  of course ,  i remember .   i miss talking to him .   cathy &apos;s a child ,  you know ,  and mitch .  .  .    .  .  . mitch has his own life .   i &apos;m glad he stayed here today .  i feel safer with him here .  
well ,  these birds live in chimneys ,  you know . 
no ,  i gotta admit this is peculiar .   did you have a light burning or something . 
what &apos;s more likely ,  they got in the room and was just panicked ,  that &apos;s all . 
oh ,  yeah ,  yeah .   how old is she now ? 
oh . 
doesn &apos;t what make me .  .  .  ? 
we never met in court or anyplace else . 
and i &apos;m glad you didn &apos;t get your lovebirds ! 
what &apos;s that ? 
ouch ! 
i don &apos;t believe you .   i think you came up to see me . 
with .  .  .  with annie ,  of course . 
you &apos;ll be able to find your way back ,  won &apos;t you ? 
i guess she and i read the same gossip columns . 
the truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd .  .  . 
 .  .  . who didn &apos;t much care for propriety or convention or .  .  . 
and you didn &apos;t come up here to see her . 
did you really write a letter to me ?  or was that a lie ,  too ? 
but you tore it up . 
why ? 
do you expect me to believe .  .  .  ? 
i couldn &apos;t possibly .  i have to get back . 
what &apos;s in this ?  nitro - glycerin ? 
i do different things on different days . 
nothing .   i go to bird shops on fridays . 
of birds ? 
sure .  but eventually ,  even the more serious - minded birds began to listen .   &quot; why should humans rule ?  &quot;  they asked themselves . 
what it was ,  probably .  .  . 
melanie ,  melanie .  .  . 
melanie .  .  . 
i got here as fast as i could .  where &apos;s cathy ? 
how long have they been gathering there ? 
even the birds sitting out there .  it does look very much the same ,  mitch .  this could be last week . 
have we still got power ? 
certainly not .  oh ,  no .  certainly not .  this will be a full grown myna bird .  full grown . 
well ,  yes ,  he &apos;ll talk .  well ,  no ,  no .  you &apos;ll have to teach him to talk . 
no ,  not in the shop .  but i can order them for you . 
well .  .  .  well ,  how soon would you want them ? 
what do you think they were after ,  miss .  .  .  ? 
i don &apos;t know why . 
and what ?  vultures ?  hawks ?  eagles ? 
i like bodega bay as well as any man .  if i thought .  .  .  
kill them all .  get rid of them .  messy animals . 
you asked to see me ,  ma &apos;am ? 
i don &apos;t know that i can do that ,  mrs .  marsh . 
i didn &apos;t mean it that way .   i meant only that i am not in a position to ask favors . 
listen to me ,  fettes ,  i &apos;m one part befuddled with drink ,  one part over - heels in love with macfarlane ,  and one part fey .  you &apos;re a lowlander ,  fettes ,  and you have no way of knowing what we highlanders call the second sight . 
excuse me ,  dr .  macfarlane  -  - 
but richardson ? 
dr .  macfarlane  -  -  you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday  -  -  the lady with the little girl ? 
but you did promise . 
we can &apos;t be sure of that . 
she &apos;s unconscious . 
dr .  macfarlane ,  i wonder if you know what happiness you &apos;ve brought those people . 
i suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor . 
what &apos;s that you say ? 
i know it  -  -  i know it  -  -  the moment i was rid of him  -  - 
i pass up no opportunities ,  i &apos;ve a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows .   we &apos;ll need subjects to demonstrate .  come along . 
he &apos;ll not leave the grave  -  -  not since wednesday last when we buried the lad . 
now that wasn &apos;t a friendly thing i heard ,  toddy .   not at all friendly . 
oh ,  it &apos;s you ,  gray .  well ,  come in .  sit down .  have a glass with me . 
then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together ,  so that it works like that whip of yours .  you know that ,  don &apos;t you ? 
i am a doctor  -  a good doctor .  i could make her walk ,  but she won &apos;t  -  she won &apos;t  -  - 
why should i be afraid of you ?  what are you holding over me ? 
but why ,  gray ?  why ? 
what did you hear ? 
 &quot; the ruffian dogs ,  the hellish pair .   the villain burke ,  the meager hare  -  -  &quot; 
i don &apos;t understand the song .  tell me plain how they did it . 
but can anything be done for her ? 
believe me ,  madame ,  if i were only a doctor ,  i would undertake this operation at once .   but i &apos;m more dominie than doctor  -  -  i &apos;ve a school to run . 
you think it &apos;ll spoil the boy ,  eh ?  was i not assistant to knox ? 
fettes  -  -  where is fettes ? 
you &apos;re not going to gray . 
you &apos;ve been with gray again . 
can i get you something ?  a glass of water ?  a transfusion ? 
how many innocent people did you leave dead back there ? 
it was one thing her dad rejected you .  but when she did you lost it . 
we won &apos;t . 
you lied at my trial . 
wrong .  answer . 
fucking zombie . 
i heard you were looking for this . 
not my arm !  what you fucking want ? 
you &apos;re him .  corvis . 
you killed that cop dutton . 
i wish i could hate him but i can &apos;t .  he said he &apos;d never hurt either of us ,  and i know it &apos;s true and .  .  .  i &apos;m going back . 
i thought we had an understanding .  i thought we understood that discretion is paramount . 
tommy leonard .  the eyewitness in the corvis case . 
fucking crow . 
anything wrong ? 
what &apos;s with your friend there ? 
what is it ? 
honey .  it &apos;s doesn &apos;t mean anything .  it &apos;s not a message . 
you killed her ! 
they killed her because she found out . 
please .  come inside . 
how can you be so sure ?  have you tested this theory ? 
i would like to explain something of my mission here . 
in the hands of a mature civilization ,  these would not be considered weapons of aggression .  but in the hands of your people -  -   we &apos;ve observed your aggressive tendencies ,  and we don &apos;t trust you with such power . 
we had our atomic wars  -  -  thousands of years ago .   after that we fought with bows and arrows .  then ,  slowly ,  we learned that fighting is no solution  -  -  that aggression leads to chaos . 
it is not enough to have men of science .  we scientists are too easily ignored  -  -  or misunderstood .  we must get important men from every field .  educators  -  -  philosophers  -  -  church leaders  -  -  men of vision and imagination  -  -  the finest minds in the world . 
come on ,  bobby .  time to go to bed . 
we sure had fun today .  we saw the space ship and we went to see professor barnhardt  -  -  and -  - 
bobby ,  you &apos;ve been dreaming again . 
maybe four thousand miles an hour .  and outside the earth &apos;s atmosphere a good deal faster . 
no  -  -  i &apos;m afraid not . 
no foolin &apos; ?  will you ? 
gee  -  -  those look like diamonds ! 
you know about the united nations ? 
now that you understand the situation more clearly ,  perhaps you &apos;d like to discuss the matter with the president
well ,  we could -  - 
you know how i feel ,  tom .  i just want to think it over . 
i was talking to mr .  carpenter . 
tom  -  -  i &apos;ve been trying to get you all afternoon -  - 
are you crazy ?  after what happened today ? 
i don &apos;t know how to thank you . 
everyone seems so -  -  
bobby &apos;s the only person i know who isn &apos;t  -  -  jittery . 
mr .  carpenter ,  i -  -   goodnight . 
what is it you want ? 
just twelve . 
you hold great hope for this meeting . 
but how  -  -  how long -  -  ? 
how did you get in here ?  and what do you want ? 
you sure about that ? 
people get hysterical enough ,  they do anything .   look ,  mr .  carpenter  -  -  if you can &apos;t identify yourself ,  i got to send you over to the army . 
i &apos;ll< / u> have to drive ! 
burn rubber does not mean warp< / u> speed< / u> ! 
well .  .  .  we blew plan a . 
the nightcrawler .   the bloodsucker .

he &apos;s telling the truth !   aren &apos;t you ,  michael ? 
what &apos;s that smell !  ? 
oh ,  no .  .  . 
we don &apos;t have one yet .   and we only have two and a half hours to come up with one . 
i said ,  i &apos;ll take you there< / u> .  nobody &apos;s going near star without me . 
max ?   you men we &apos;re having company again ? 
i &apos;ll hitch . 
michael ,  are you still in bed ? 
sam .   is everything all right ? 
where &apos;s michael ? 
well if we &apos;re in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen . 
oh ,  no .   now what ? 
there &apos;s nothing wrong with max .   i don &apos;t know why you don &apos;t  -  - 
say hello to thorn . 
but i don &apos;t think it &apos;s what you really want to do ,  is it ? 
is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner ? 
something the matter ? 
let me tell you something about boys .   they &apos;re like weeds .   they grow best when they &apos;re ignored . 
does it burn ? 
ex - hippies .   my mom was one .    i came this close to being called moon child ,  or moon beam or something .   but star &apos;s great .   i like< / u> star . 
i wouldn &apos;t have given my mom such a hard time about moving here if i &apos;d known i was going to meet you . 
when ? 
then it &apos;s not too late for us .  .  . 
you &apos;ve got to put this on . 
this room is mine . 
you &apos;re beautiful . 
what did you< / u> do last night ?   you look wasted . 
you don &apos;t suppose grandpa &apos;s an alien ,  do you ? 
michael ? 
we &apos;ve got to stick together ,  sam .  you &apos;ve got to help me . 
no !   we can &apos;t tell mom !   please ,  sam .   don &apos;t tell her . 
it &apos;s that girl from the boardwalk .  is she one of them ? 
well ,  where was he ?   where did he go ? 
was that dog ,  the norwegian dog ? 
couldn &apos;t make much of it myself . 
too damn dangerous . 
how you doin &apos; ,  old boy ?

i said where ?   where &apos;d you go ?  ! 
lighten your load ,  sucker .   you ain &apos;t the judge and executioner around here ! 
childs !   that a fuse ? 
cut that out ,  copper .   nauls ?   what &apos;s taking you ?  ! 
what are you doing ? 
palmer ,  you and copper tie everyone down .   real tight . 
load of bullshit . 
spaceship of some kind . 
not the only one . 
neither will we . 
maybe we shouldn &apos;t make it . 
hey ,  sweden !  !  ! 
well ,  who &apos;s got access to it ? 
would that test have worked ? 
now hold him . 
i guess you &apos;re okay . 
 &apos;bout eighty kilos southwest . 
couple seconds of an argentine disco station . 
we &apos;re on fire ! 
you &apos;re not thinking of going after them ,  are you ? 
let &apos;s rush him .   he &apos;s not going to blow us all up . 
pure nonsense .   this won &apos;t prove a damn thing . 
sanchez ,  you and palmer search the inside .  .  . 
what kind of test ? 
we &apos;ve got to find fuchs .   when we find him  -  -  we kill him . 
what is it ? 
you know damn well what we both make of it . 
we should sleep in shifts . 
 .  .  .  made sure i got ahead of him on the towline on the way back .  .  .  cut him loose . 
the hall of books . 
no one ever comes here .   my mother told me stories about it late at night .   they tell all the children . 
i think we should go on by ourselves . 
please ,  just listen to me .  .  .  your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt .   i &apos;ll find her . 
yes .   just about here . 
right up your alley ,  i would think .  you are from the past ,  yes ? 
i can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for  -  -    -  -  800 , 000 years perhaps .   don &apos;t keep me in suspense .   what year ? 
when was his mother taken ? 
yes .  .  . 
it &apos;s what they want you to see . 
what &apos;s it all for ? 
this has to end . 
nothing to do ,  i &apos;m afraid .   i &apos;m just a librarian after all .   wasn &apos;t exactly made for all this swashbuckling .   very byronic end ,  though .   i appreciate that .   do you know byron ? 
go back to the light .   you weren &apos;t made for this .   i was .  .  .  i was made for this moment . 
what &apos;s your name ? 
and centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again ,  we couldn &apos;t .   our adaptation was too successful .   we survived .  .  .  we endured .  .  .  for this . 
why ? 
now will you go ? 
that was a foolish thing to do . 
i could have a hundred morlocks here in thirty seconds . 
next time then .   we perambulate here most every night . 
well there &apos;s something new . 
talk away ,  professor . 
all right ,  what is it now ? 
oh dammit ,  i love you !   i can &apos;t eat ,  i can &apos;t sleep ,  i can &apos;t think ,  all i do is moon over you and  -  -  hum ,  apparently . 
i know it &apos;s not a diamond but  -  - 
alex ,  what is it ? 
let &apos;s walk through the park .  .  . 
alex ,  what is it ? 
alex .  .  .  ?  ! 
my god .  .  . 
alex .  .  .  people are staring . 
let them . 
where &apos;s the challenge in that ? 
emma actually likes chalk dust  -  -  says it smells like me . 
the most able inventor i know and you can &apos;t tie a simple four - in -  hand . 
alex ,  really .  .  .  good luck tonight .  she &apos;s a fine girl ,  and she &apos;s done wonderful things for you . 
there are some things i need to say to you .   you may not like hearing them ,  but i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ll ever get another chance  -  - 
but you won &apos;t listen .   you won &apos;t see me ,  you won &apos;t see anyone .   what would you like me to tell jamie ?  that uncle alex is busy ?   that uncle alex is hiding up there in his laboratory  -  - 
i know that  -  - 
is there a lot of illness ? 
it &apos;s hard for me to imagine a better place .   where i come from there &apos;s so much .  .  .  frenzy .   day and night .   it seems we &apos;re all running faster and faster .  .  .    .  .  .  all in identical bowler hats . 
oh ,  that explains everything . 
that machine  -  - 
i might find the truth rather hard to understand ?  .  .  .  can you go back ? 
you seem fascinated by the stars . 
this is magnificent .  .  . 
i don &apos;t understand . 
you &apos;ve welcomed me into your home .  into your lives .   everyone has .  .  .  for the first time in a long time it doesn &apos;t hurt quite so much .   i thank you for that . 
yes .  .  .  a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship -  shape . 
alexander ,  take my son away .   take him back to your time .   will you do that ? 
yes ,  sir ,  he  -  - 
but i know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum . 
sir ,  that curriculum is forty years out of date .   the students today are looking toward the new century  -  -  they want to be challenged and inspired ,  not spoon - fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times .   they want to explore . 
no ,  sir  -  - 
we had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago .  his name was moren .   do you know him ? 
he said he traveled for two months . 
we have to go after them ,  find where  -  -   ! 
my fowl have polluted the yard . 
if i might explain ,  sir  -  - 
should we be .  .  . 
well ,  your condition &apos;s pretty serious . 
i &apos;m just looking at you .  does that make you uncomfortable ? 
i didn &apos;t dream it .  i may have been asleep but it wasn &apos;t a dream .  becker sits down in a chair ,  half - shrouded in the light . 
becker ,  how do you sleep at night ? 
no .  i didn &apos;t .  i swear i didn &apos;t .  i probably helped push you to kill yourself ,  but i didn &apos;t do it . 
how did you come to know their names ? 
i don &apos;t understand .  .  . 
i didn &apos;t put you in alpine grove . 
you done with your small talk ? 
i &apos;m sorry i can &apos;t tell you more about your father &apos;s death ,  mr .  starks .  our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the alpine grove &apos;s staff changed and i &apos;m afraid we didn &apos;t have the best record system before then . 
well ,  dr .  lorenson is still here at the hospital .  if she was here at the time your father was ,  then i &apos;m sure she &apos;d be of more help to you . 
jackie ,  go play in the snow . 
your mom take anything before this happened ? 
stop it !  stop it !  jackie covers her ears and looks at him ,  pleading with her eyes .  starks &apos; eyes plead right back . 
william starks is dead .  .  .   &#93 beat] i &apos;ve been to his grave . 
i looked it up . 
but no one knew until after .  .  . 
 &#93 softly] i want to trust you .  should i trust you ? 
alpine grove still exists .  i looked it up on the net .  we should go there and see if there &apos;s still anyone around who might have known what happened to you . 
maybe .  i don &apos;t know .  seems more likely becker does ,  but at the very least she knows how i died . 
me ,  too . 
you &apos;re sure ? 
what ?  what are you thinking ? 
i &apos;ve been ok . 
it &apos;s ok .  it &apos;s ok .  relax .  it &apos;s just a cut .  we can get it fixed .  but we need to get you to the hospital now .  how &apos;d you get that ? 
i don &apos;t understand . 
my god you look exactly like him . 
well ,  do you think dr .  becker would have any idea ? 
what about the world ? 
and how do you know that ? 
william ,  i can &apos;t indulge these delusions ,  even when you &apos;re in this state . 
he &apos;s having absence  &#93 pronounced  &quot; absance &quot; ] seizures when he stares off into space like he does .  he has them so often that that &apos;s why he hasn &apos;t learned to speak properly . 
i tried to kill my wife . 
 &#93 beat] how do you know ? 
mackenzie ,   &#93 beat] what if we are crazy ? 
hey ,  mister ,  you need a ride ? 
can you drive ? 
in case you hadn &apos;t figured ,  it &apos;s christmas eve .  you &apos;re never gonna get a cab here . 
well ,  where are you from ? 
no . 
no ,  you won &apos;t .  you &apos;ll die of cold out there and then i &apos;ll have to feel guilty .  and i &apos;ve already got more guilt than i know what to do with .   &#93 beat] do you want something to drink ? 
well ,  good for you . 
you don &apos;t think that &apos;s crazy ? 
hon . 
 .  .  .  only for one day and we &apos;ll be back tomorrow night . 
i &apos;m asking you seriously ,  sarah ,  a stranger ? 
yeah ,  i could too .   but .  .  .  i don &apos;t know why i &apos;m even asking you this .  it &apos;s just .  .  .  we can &apos;t place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie .  i don &apos;t know .   i keep hearing words  -  -  impossible  -  -  inconceivable .   if just one person would say .  .  . 
could you identify  &apos;em ,  if ya saw  &apos;em again ? 
who do you think did it ? 
no ! 
that &apos;s certainly possible . 
we don &apos;t have a whole lotta choice ,  do we ?   i can &apos;t figure out if they &apos;re real smart or just really ,  really lucky . 
oh shit . 
don &apos;t .   i &apos;m married .   i don &apos;t feel good .   i &apos;ve been sick . 
don &apos;t hurt me .   harlan .   please . 
so j . d .  ,  what are you studying in school ? 
so how come you don &apos;t have any kids ? 
well ,  if you don &apos;t mind me sayin &apos; so ,  he sounds like a real asshole . 
what ?  !   parole officer ?   you mean you &apos;re a criminal ? 
you &apos;re a bank robber ? 
no ,  i mean how would you do it ?   do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what ? 
you &apos;re kinda the best thing that &apos;s happened to me in a long time . 
jimmy !   hello ,  stranger .   what in the world are you doin &apos; here ? 
i am funny .   i &apos;m real funny . 
i have a savings account with about sixty - seven hundred dollars in it .  now i know you won &apos;t be able to get it out ,  but i &apos;m good for it .   i need that money .   can you wire me the sixty - seven hundred dollars and i &apos;ll pay you back ?   please ,  i &apos;m desperate . 
good .   that was good .   where do i go ? 
can i just ask you one other thing ? 
will you at least see how it fits ? 
so whaddya think .   i mean .  .  .  i could .  .  .  uh .  .  .  get a job .   of some kind .   i mean you &apos;ve been tellin &apos; me that for years ,  right ? 
you wanna take it out of your wallet ,  please ? 
well ,  wait now .   i still have to ask darryl if i can go . 
oh yeah ,  sure ,  thelma ,  that lantern will come in real handy .   maybe we could tow your car behind ,  in case he steals the spark plugs . 
 &apos;cause i didn &apos;t ask him . 
how much longer is it gonna be ?   i &apos;m hungry . 
i haven &apos;t seen a place like this since i left texas . 
alright .  .  .   i changed my mind .   i &apos;ll have a margarita with and a shot of cuervo on the side ,  please . 
so what if he was ?   it &apos;s all your years of waitin &apos; tables has made you jaded ,  that &apos;s all . 
why don &apos;t you tell him to just to get lost once and for all ? 
shouldn &apos;t we go to the cops ?   i mean ,  i think we should tell the police . 
i don &apos;t know .   just tell  &apos;em what happened . 
oh ,  i don &apos;t know .   i &apos;m just nervous .  i gotta figure out what to do . 
but you think he fools around . 
i .  .  .  i don &apos;t know .   i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re askin &apos; me . 
i just don &apos;t see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride .   did you see his butt ?   darryl doesn &apos;t have a cute butt .   you could park a car in the shadow of his ass . 
how do i look ? 
oh ,  thelma .   oh ,  no . 
eighty - eight dollars ain &apos;t gonna make a dent ,  baby girl . 
i &apos;m sorry .   well ,  we need the money .  now we have it . 
you think you &apos;ve found your calling ? 
oh ,  come on !   murder one and armed robbery ,  thelma ! 
before . 
oh yeah .   you mean peek - a - poos . 
oh ,  christ .   i hate this guy . 
what do we do ?   what do you want to do ?  ! 
what ? 
well ,  i figure if you take a state policeman ,  shoot up his car ,  take his gun and lock him in the trunk ,  it &apos;s best to just get on out of the state if you can . 
i don &apos;t want to see any more beef jerky .   i mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window .  it &apos;s drivin &apos; me crazy .   the whole car smells like it . 
you do ? 
shit .   i &apos;m gettin &apos; tired . 
what &apos;d i say again ? 
thelma ,  that is not an option . 
what ?  !   what d &apos;you think ?  ! 
i guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty . 
what in the hell is that up there ? 
now what ? 
then let &apos;s not get caught . 
we &apos;re fine !   how are you ? 
heavy ?  heavy ?  !  what i wouldn &apos;t give to know what heavy feels like ,  you insensitive prick . 
maybe you &apos;re right .  i should look on the bright side .  i mean ,  i &apos;ve still got my health .  .  .   i &apos;m out of here .  i &apos;ve got to get up at six a . m .  to move my boss &apos;s brother into his apartment . 
my mary  -  -  she &apos;s not in japan ,  she &apos;s single ,  and she &apos;s got no rugrats .  she does have a little gambling problem ,  she plays the football cards a bit too much ,  but she &apos;s a babe ,  a surgeon babe ! 
no you mean .  .  .  ? 
the lazy fuck just didn &apos;t bother to look her up . 
didn &apos;t they tell you ?  that hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak .  you got a fucking horseshoe up your ass ,  man . 
how the hell did you get here anyway ? 
well ?  what are you waiting for ? 
you bet your ass i &apos;m right .  you don &apos;t go out with a loaded gun ,  you empty the barrels ! 
dom wooganowski .  duh . 
so .  .  .  i see you made the news . 
this is a good one ,  mare .  sounds like his partner &apos;s all lubed up . 
here ,  just have one of these then . 
i &apos;m worried about you ,  man .  you better learn to have a pop once in a while or you &apos;re gonna fall off the wagon .  you &apos;re being a fanatic and that ain &apos;t healthy . 
yeah ,  don &apos;t talk in someone &apos;s backswing . 
i &apos;m gonna get a soda ,  you want one ? 
the hell with that .  no one &apos;s gonna tell me who i can and can &apos;t work with . 
 -  -  there &apos;s this one kid ,  we call him mongo on account of he &apos;s a mongoloid .  he got out of his cage once and  -  - 
that &apos;s what i said ,  so i went out and got him a leash you know ,  one of those clothesline runners for the backyard .  he &apos;s got plenty of room out there to dig .  the kid &apos;s really blossomed .  now i can take him to ball games ,  movies  -  -  you know ,  happy stuff . 
that grandmother of yours  -  -  she &apos;s really something . 
you know ,  sometimes i wish i could be like magda and not go home .  i &apos;d like to just bounce around for awhile ,  do a little traveling .  .  . 
no .  but the boston globe critic jay carr hated it . 
yeah . 
mary ah ,  forget it . 
she &apos;s blackmailing you ,  right ? 
thanks ,  healy .  good work . 
miami ? 
jai alai ? 
all the same ,  i still want to call her .  i know it sounds crazy  -  -  mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life  -  -  but ,  i don &apos;t know ,  maybe i can help her out .   the poor thing &apos;s had it tough  -  -  she &apos;s in a wheelchair for godsakes . 
okay ,  tell you what :  i &apos;ll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from japan . 
yeah well fuck you !  you just can &apos;t stand the fact that it was my turn . 
well ,  i &apos;ll tell her i ran into you . 
i knew shit .  the only thing i knew was that you were a fake and i made up everything else .   my real name &apos;s norm .  i deliver pizzas . 
that seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch  -  -  you sure it won &apos;t kill him ? 
you little fuck . 
like i &apos;m going to try to figure out a guy who &apos;s idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick &apos;s face
a salesman  -  -  that &apos;s what i am .  i mean ,  i &apos;m gonna be anyway .  i &apos;m starting my own company  -  -  video sales  -  -  just as soon as i get enough seed money . 
i &apos;d go with the seven . 
no ,  it should be  &apos;a hockey player with great pecs .  &apos;
it means you &apos;re too hard on guys . 
have you been up all night again ? 
you picked that up on the scanner .  we gotta move . 
good lookin &apos; ? 
hey hey ,  what did you say pat &apos;s last name was ? 
back when i was your age i always used to make myself a big banana split after sex .  i think you &apos;re gonna need one tonight . 
magda ! 
oh ,  hi hon .  just straightening up . 
pat does projects all over the world . 
what &apos;s up ,  doc ? 
hey ,  you &apos;re limping .  did you just hurt yourself ? 
so who you taking to the prom ? 
i &apos;m sorry .  i should &apos;ve told you ,  he &apos;s got a thing about his ears . 
are you all right ? 
ted ,  i &apos;m so sorry .  are you going to be okay ? 
oh .  so .  .  .  what brings you down here ? 
well .  .  .  why don &apos;t you move back ? 
oh for the love of god ! 
just relax ,  dear .  now ,  um .  .  .  what exactly are we looking at here ? 
now i &apos;ve seen it all .  what the hell were you thinking ? 
see you ,  warren . 
we &apos;ve been hailing the groznyy for the last hour ,  mr .  secretary .  the groznyy refuses to stop . 
with the caveat that it is not made public in any way ,  shape or form .   and we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest .  i cannot stress this point enough . 
as if dealing with the russians wasn &apos;t hard enough ,  we gotta worry about our own house . 
how does a guy get a rep like that ? 
they &apos;re going to be pressing for a military solution soon .  we can &apos;t afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats .  we need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here . 
what happened to speak when spoken to ? 
my father  -  - 
we &apos;re getting everyone together as fast as we can . 
we gave so much to get here .  i don &apos;t know .  sometimes i think what the hell did we do it for ? 
christ ,  ken ,  you know it &apos;s not that easy . 
 -  -  i have the authority .  i am the commander - in - chief of the united states ,  and i say when we go to war ! 
when are you going to be home ? 
what happens to you ?  i &apos;m not leaving without you . 
i want an hour with him . 
it &apos;s tuesday .  you said to call .  when do i get my 45 minutes ? 
yeah ?  who was he talking to ?  acheson ?  come on ,  o &apos;donnell ,  everyone &apos;s wondering what &apos;s going on .  what &apos;s acheson doing in town ?  and don &apos;t give me some bullshit about dnc think tanks .  acheson &apos;s mr .  cold war . 
get back out there ,  kid .  remember to hit  &apos;em hard . 
we have to try the blockades .  it probably won &apos;t work .  it may just be delaying the inevitable .  but we can &apos;t just go to war without trying not to . 
all right .   &apos;cause you get armed boarders climbing into soviet ships ,  shots being fired across bows .  .  . 
what about these low - level flights ?  they &apos;re starting in what ?  an hour ?  do you realize what you &apos;re letting yourself in for ? 
he &apos;s right ,  we can &apos;t rescind defcon 2 .  the soviets will think we &apos;ve gotten sweet on them . 
jesus christ ,  o &apos;donnell ,  you &apos;re the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution . 
didn &apos;t know adlai had it in him .  too bad he didn &apos;t have this stuff in  &apos;52 . 
don &apos;t take it to court ,  but we &apos;ve got good circumstantial evidence .  .  .   walter agrees .  my gut &apos;s telling me khruschev &apos;s turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message . 
we give them something .  we tell them we &apos;ll remove the missiles from turkey say ,  six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage .  we also tell them if they go public about it ,  we deny it and the deal is off . 
that may be why khruschev &apos;s introducing this guy .  we &apos;ve been burned by his usual players in the formal channels ,  so he brings in an honest broker . 
my specialists are in agreement :  this morning &apos;s letter is not khruschev .  last night &apos;s letter was .   the evidence supports only one conclusion :  there has been a coup ,  and khruschev was replaced overnight . 
bob ? 
captain ,  belay that order !   bob ,  where &apos;s that coming from ! 
i see . 
brooks ,  what &apos;s a perceptive fellow like you ,  doing in a joint like this ?  let me buy you a glass of some of that russian shit you like . 
you know how in your big cities ,  you got your niggers and you got your puerto ricans ?  well out here we got indians .  that &apos;s just the way it is . 
who are you ? 
we got the wire ya was comin &apos; .  you &apos;re the indian official ,  yeah ? 
somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction ,  officer crow foot . 
respect the dead ,  hoss .  because when  -  - 
hey ,  hey ,  hey .  j .  edgar would &apos;ve loved you .  he &apos;d love anybody who joined the bureau to ,  what was it ?   &quot; to enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests &quot;  ? 
meet me at base .  over . 
white eagle feather through the circle .  that &apos;s their symbol . 
genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings .  an incontrovertible motive .  and definite footprints on jimmy looks twice at maisy blue legs house . 
you weren &apos;t sent here to go off on your own detail ,  ray .  you were sent here to assist in a selective operations unit .  these regional agents are inept  -  -  that &apos;s why they were sent out here to the graveyard ,  to indian country .  i need you behind me ,  ray .  not pulling against me . 
it may have been maggie &apos;s way of saying  &quot; get off my ass .  &quot; 
you ever put your hands on me again and you &apos;ll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking everglades ,  mister . 
 -  -  what the hell is red deer table ? 
we were sworn in on the constitution to protect federal matters ,  ray .  i don &apos;t know about uranium ,  i don &apos;t know about red dog table  -  -  all i know is we did our job .  it &apos;s over . 
to us indians ,  our spiritual relatives are as close as family .  i &apos;ve got seven mothers on this reservation .  sisters .  brothers .  you ain &apos;t one of them . 
what was he saying ? 
the old man ?  he &apos;s gonna tell you who killed leo ? 
it &apos;s not real . 
cuz i &apos;m a skin ? 
you tell me .  you tell me who went to the b . i . a .   -  -  bureau of indian annihilation and said i was messin &apos; with your case ,  man .  i don &apos;t give a goddamn about your case . 
where &apos;s maggie ?  where &apos;d ya take her . 
do they come in dreams ,  these visions ? 
i &apos;m a full - blood oglala . 
bullshit .  you had a vision .  you got sign from the old ones . 
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing here .  national interest .  national security .  only this time it &apos;s not gold .  it &apos;s uranium . 
ray .  ray ,  don &apos;t let go now ,  man .  ray .  .  . 
what about the water .  .  . 
you burned an american flag today .  and left it for me .  .  . 
your relatives must &apos;ve taught you something . 
do you want a coffee ? 
you ever try solitary confinement ? 
not for long ,  richard .  you got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation ,  and you didn &apos;t deliver . 
get up out of the chair ,  richard . 
yeah ,  most likely . 
everybody &apos;s got to be somewhere . 
i beg your pardon . 
you saw a mig 21 ? 
if you were directly above him ,  how did you see him ? 
you seemed determined to do that anyway .  .  why didn &apos;t you tell me you were a famous mig insulter ?  maverick would it have made a difference ? 
what would ? 
well ,  what you need .  .  . what you have to keep looking for .  .  . what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you .  who can match you move for move .  then you &apos;ve got something .   i &apos;m sorry . 
that stuff about the mig .  i was out of line . 
is that all ?  charlie what else do you want ? 
i don &apos;t mix with the boys .  i work here .  let &apos;s keep it professional . 
that &apos;s true .  what are you ? 
does it bother you ? 
what he said .  .  .  &quot; there &apos;s nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result .  &quot; 
what if you kill yourself ?  think of everything you &apos;ll miss .  maverick there is lots of stuff i don &apos;t know about .  .  .   fine wine .  .  .  great art .  .  .  the opera .  i guess if i live long enough ,  i &apos;ll get to it .  if i don &apos;t ,  i &apos;ll never miss it . 
this is it ,  then . 
i &apos;m not good company .  i should be alone . 
you don &apos;t believe that . 
you &apos;re crazy .   that &apos;s a pretty silly game . 
want to play the game ? 
one more . 
looks like a tie . 
you weren &apos;t gonna say goodbye ? 
i &apos;ve got a gift just like you do .  my gift is i just know what people mean ,  even if they can &apos;t say it .  it helps when you &apos;re trying to communicate with fighter pilots .  like what you just said was  &quot; i &apos;m embarrassed ,  i feel i &apos;ve done something wrong ,  that i &apos;ve failed ,  and i don &apos;t think i can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting ,  intelligent woman like yourself .  &quot;  that about it ? 
sir ? 
i &apos;ll lock on them ,  cougar .   gotcha covered ,  don &apos;t nobody move . 
you better not be ragging me .  .  .  if you &apos;re flying upside down .  .  .

this is crazy ! 
they must be broken .  i &apos;m hanging in my straps !  we &apos;re inverted ! 
what ?  where &apos;re you -  - hey ,  where in the hell are you going ? 
what do you mean ?  it doesn &apos;t get to look much better than that ? 
ohhh mother ! 
now have you got it ?   have you still got it ? 
is it you ? 
you &apos;re not supposed to .  .  . 
so i &apos;ve heard . 
this is evan mitchell ,  he steers the thing . 
keller ,  black lion squadron .  i knew him at pensacola .  he &apos;s damn good . 
what do these guys think ,  i made cougar quit ? 
i &apos;ve lost him  -  -  where is he ? 
we did it ! 
you see all those guys with gold on their shoulders !  !  ?  .  .  .  oh ,  no ,  i think that was johnson ,  air boss of the kitty hawk ! 
come on ,  we &apos;re next . 
stay with him !  tighten your turn ! 
that &apos;s kazanski . 
but ,  skipper ,  cougar &apos;s been picked for top gun .  .  . he &apos;s the best of the best ! 
come off -  - come off right .  i &apos;m on my way in .  you go free ,  i &apos;m engaging . 
ice ,  roll off ,  i can shoot him . 
on the nose ? 
he &apos;s seat of the pants .  .  .  completely unpredictable  -  -  nothing by the book .  all over the sky .  but i don &apos;t know ,  skip ,  he &apos;s really got something . 
i .  .  . forgot something . 
helping him in . 
he &apos;s a good pilot . 
maverick .  .  .  where &apos;d you get that call sign ? 
for the same reason you are . 
sometimes it &apos;s luck ,  but in this case ,  he earned it .  .  .  i served with your old man . 
they waved him off .  he thought he knew better .  he hit the ramp .

it &apos;s a bit of a scandal .  my parents live in a small town . 
it &apos;s a hellhole .  three motels and a mannequin factory .  my dad worked there for thirty - five years . 
this is so nice .  it &apos;s like where andy hardy would live .  what &apos;s it called again ? 
kinship .  and what &apos;s here ? 
that &apos;s why they all give you such a hard time in workshop . 
it &apos;s okay ,  professor tripp .  carrie ,  howard ,  the others  -  -  they &apos;re right .  my stories are annoying .  they go on and on and on ,  and the longer they go on the more annoying they become ,  until finally you just want to grab something heavy and  -  - 
want a bite ? 
it &apos;s because you don &apos;t eat . 
hey . 
crabtree ?  he doesn &apos;t even know james . 
right .  anyway ,  i was wondering if i could borrow your car .  mine &apos;s sort of out of commission . 
professor tripp . 
i need to talk to you . 
so .  i guess we just divorce our spouses ,  marry each other ,  and have this baby ,  right ?  simple . 
my god ,  i wear the same scent as a transvestite .  she is a transvestite ,  isn &apos;t :  she ? 
well ,  no ,  i don &apos;t see any way .   and i know how hard it is for you to  -  -  to lose this chance . 
heavy .  smells like gunpowder . 
what &apos;s he doing out there ? 
someone stole my car . 
he told you . 
i know . 
that perfume you &apos;re wearing ,  antonia .  it wouldn &apos;t happen to be cristaile ,  would it ? 
couldn &apos;t he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing ? 
grady ? 
oh ? 
say ,  professor tripp ,  is all that stuff true about errol flynn ?  how he used to put coke on his dick .  to make himself ,  you know ,  like ,  last longer ? 
yo ,  traxler . 
what made you pull out that old thing ? 
and ? 
she &apos;ll be twelve next week .  we &apos;re throwing a big party on saturday .  wish i could ask you to come .  .  . 
cherry . 
then why the fuck are you giving it back to me ?  ! 
she was going to throw it out ,  wasn &apos;t she ?  just toss it like a scrap of wood . 
then what ?  what ?  ! 
ah ,  come on . 
anna will be away at camp .  the house will be quiet .  it &apos;s better when it &apos;s quiet . 
c &apos;mon ,  walter . 
you &apos;re a good man ,  walter .  okay ,  you did some wrong things ,  but inside you &apos;re a good ,  decent man . 
it &apos;s crazy out there .   young girls wearing mini this and mini that .  sometimes when i walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman ,  she makes me feel like i &apos;m bothering her .  she stares down like she &apos;s afraid to look at me .  why she do that ?  why can &apos;t she look me in the face ? 
there &apos;s a million birds here . 
i &apos;d love to hear it . 
see anything interesting ? 
and when you sit by the window ,  watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by ,  do you wave your wanger at the girls ?  is that when you jerk off ? 
sure they do .  but outside they &apos;ve got trees around them .  the trees shade them from the sun .  of course ,  the plants enrich the soil around the trees .  one of nature &apos;s symbiotic relationships . 
a man was badly beaten across the street .  you know anything about that ? 
i wasn &apos;t feeling well . 
he i . d .  &apos;d the assailant .  the description matches you pretty well . 
no . 
robin ? 
i &apos;m sure .  thank you all the same . 
yes . 
i don &apos;t want to hurt my daddy . 
and how &apos;s your job ? 
you seem a little hostile today . 
walter ,  i &apos;d like you to try something for me . 
is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch ? 
because if you did ,  i know a therapist named ryan .  i also know a therapist named chung . 
how do you feel about that ? 
then why are you talking about this ? 
you know that if anything happens ,  i spend the rest of my life in prison .  no parole ,  no nothing . 
we &apos;ll talk about it more on thursday . 
go home ,  walter . 
close your eyes . 
i &apos;d like you to close your eyes . 
to relax . 
no ,  i am not going to  -  - 
sorry .   where is she ? 
where ? 
don &apos;t ever do that again . 
she &apos;s still really hurt .  .  .  and angry .  i don &apos;t know .  .  .  if she will ever .  .  .  forgive me .  i understand that .  i do .  i just hope .  .  .  i just want her to .  .  . 
here &apos;s this nice ,  hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work .  i mean ,  who rides the bus anymore ? 
very weird . 
you don &apos;t hang out with the other guys . 
you never spoke to me before . 
southern light . 
your windows face south .  northern light is the purest .  but southern light is very good . 
doesn &apos;t it get noisy ? 
i thought you were just shy ,  but now i think it &apos;s something else . 
so .  .  .  what &apos;s your dark secret ? 
so ,  you &apos;re not a dyke . 
no you &apos;re not . 
so ,  what did you do ? 
i never hurt them .  never . 
depraved ?  my mistake . 
you don &apos;t molest little girls anymore ,  do you ? 
you mean the time you &apos;re locked away ? 
is it their innocence ?  their beauty ?  .  .  . 
and what do you tell yourself now ? 
being here ,  with me . 
i &apos;ve got problems . 
i don &apos;t need a plant . 
thank you . 
don &apos;t be scared ,  walter . 
i heard they were filthy birds . 
nice shot ,  lins . 
bud !   hippy &apos;s on the bitch - box .   it &apos;s a call from topside .   that new company man . 
okay ,  jammer .   no problem .   you stay right here .  i have to go there to the end .  .  .  you &apos;ll see my lights .   we &apos;ll stay in voice contact .   just hold onto the rope .   five more minutes .   okay ? 
i can &apos;t believe you let them do this ! 
i was ,  but i managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here .   only here isn &apos;t where i left it ,  is it ,  bud ? 
you wimp .   i had a lot riding on this .   they bought you .  .  .  more like least rented you cheap -  - 
you need me .   nobody knows the systems on this rig better than i do .   what is something was to go wrong after the explorer clears off ?   what would have you done ? 
what are you still wearing that for ? 
did you get anything on the cameras .   video or anything ? 
but you think it &apos;s something else .   what ?   one of ours ? 
look .   i &apos;m just trying to hold this situation together .   i can &apos;t allow you to cause this kind of hysteria -  - 
god ,  you are the most stubborn woman i ever knew . 
you owe me one ,  virgil . 
can &apos;t get to it .   have to pull this panel off .  you go any tools ? 
son of a bitch ! 
i don &apos;t know how ! 
triple time sounds like a lotta money ,  bud .   it ain &apos;t .   i &apos;m sorry .  .  . 
cab one ,  do you see it yet ? 
cab one ,  radiation readings ? 
i want  &apos;round - the - clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras .   we need early warning if the soviet craft try another incursion . 
figured that out for yourself ,  did you ? 
hey ! 
you boss is having a full - on meltdown .   guy &apos;s fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we &apos;re all ringside ! 
then how come you &apos;re not with him ? 
a little more so this time . 
but i think we should talk about it .  or are you fully convinced that we too won &apos;t understand each other ? 
but where are you going ? 
and how long will you be away ? 
and have you any other truths to tell me ? 
have you decided ? 
i have a feeling that you &apos;re not used to being alone . 
as far as i &apos;m concerned ,  i think she &apos;s alive .  .  .  why ,  even this morning .  .  .  that business about the shark .  .  .  it wasn &apos;t at all true . 
nothing but the usual argument .  .  .  the only thing was  -  -  if i remember correctly  -  -  that she said she had a need to be alone . 
you &apos;re very fond of anna ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
and yet ,  she seemed to feel that our love for her  -  -  mine ,  yours ,  even her father &apos;s ,  in a certain sense  -  -  weren &apos;t enough for her ,  or didn &apos;t mean much to her . 
yes ,  you should go . 
sandro  .  .  .  maybe it &apos;s best that you go in alone . 
what is it ,  claudia ? 
then why do you say them ? 
but why am i so infatuated with you ? 
and you leave me here all alone .  .  .  in this hotel room .  .  . 
sandro  .  .  . what &apos;s the matter ? 
did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby ? 
but where did you finally end up ? 
shouldn &apos;t we try to find a quieter place ? 
please ,  you come too .  .  . 
now what do i have to do to be left in peace ? 
it &apos;s as smooth and slick as oil . 
i &apos;m going ashore to take a look around the island .  there are some ruins up there .  .  . 
and what are we going to do now ? 
and who is this ? 
because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman . 
what other boat ? 
i only exchanged a few casual words with her ,  as one would ordinarily do on a public bus .  .  . 
thank you . 
patrizia ,  what are you going to do ? 
you should have told ettore .  he always manages to get what he wants . 
here i am ,  patrizia .  i &apos;m always here . 
i would like to ask you something . 
it &apos;s a sin to be fat . 
then tell me .  where are your sheets ? 
for what ? 
uh huh . 
you want to talk about the baby don &apos;t you ? 
down .  .  .  there . 
i went to my room . 
yes . 
what &apos;s your real name ? 
would you like some ? 
why do you smoke ? 
no questions . 
why should i ? 
do you ? 
agnes ,  did you love your mother ? 
and you &apos;re unhappy . 
sometimes ,  yes . 
you can tell me . 
that you &apos;re a mistake ? 
agnes ,  oh agnes ,  agnes i want you to do something .  i want you to pretend that i &apos;m your mother .  oh yes ,  only this time i want you to tell me what you &apos;re feeling ,  alright ? 
agnes ,  you &apos;re ugly !  .  .  .  what do you say ?  of course you do .  agnes ,  you &apos;re ugly !  .  .  .  what do you say ? 
are you intelligent ? 
and why am i here ? 
how did you have a baby ? 
did anyone else know about the baby ? 
and then what happened ? 
hm hmm . 
who ? 
is someone in the room with you ? 
she said michael . 
it &apos;s bleeding .  .  .  i &apos;m bleeding .  .  .  my god it won &apos;t stop ,  i can &apos;t get it to stop .   let go of me ,  i wish you were dead . 
i hate him for what he did to me . 
mother miriam was with you wasn &apos;t she ? 
 ?  ?  ? 
all i want is one more week . 
yes ,  that &apos;s because i &apos;m getting to her . 
i &apos;ll have a decision by next week . 
marie &apos;s dead mama . 
oh ,  we own the land around here .  but we rent it out .  we keep a few acres for ourselves ,   some wheat ,  corn ,  some vegetables . 
no .  we work the land alone .  no - one but sister marguerite and i are permitted contact with the public . 
yes . 
but what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever doctor .  but it does make all the difference to agnes . 
who was the father ? 
she can &apos;t even remember the birth .  do you think she &apos;d admit to the conception ? 
no .  .  .  not in the eyes of the police . 
you don &apos;t really believe something like that happened do you ? 
shortly after she came to us . 
this was before her pregnancy ? 
not simple ,  no . 
you hate us don &apos;t you ? 
it &apos;s my affair too . 
no ,  it just makes you doubly responsible doesn &apos;t it ? 
like keeping her home from school ? 
bullshit yourself ! 
do you think agnes is still attached to god ? 
may i be present ? 
she &apos;s been touched by god ,  yes . 
don &apos;t be ridiculous . 
but she is not an enigma mother .  everything that agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry .  one ,  two ,  three ,  right down the line . 
this is permission to take her apart . 
hasn &apos;t she had enough ? 
was it you ? 
the baby ? 
lay them down . 
here ,  mate ,  that &apos;s my hoop ,  stop playing with it . 
well  -  - 
oh you can have it ,  i &apos;m packing it in  -  -  it depresses me . 
i &apos;m a deserter . 
sure . 
leave them drums alone . 
if you so much as breathe heavy on them ,  i &apos;m out on strike . 
yeah ,  you know ,   &quot; o . k .  buster ,  follow that car ,  there &apos;s a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close !  &quot; 
we &apos;re nearly there ,  sir . 
he doesn &apos;t like me ,  honest ,  i can tell  .  .  .  it &apos;s  &apos;cos i &apos;m little . 
are you going in ? 
grotty ? 
only susan campey ,  our resident teenager .  you &apos;ll have to love her .  she &apos;s your symbol . 
you see ,  he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher . 
sure .   . 
what &apos;s up ? 
come on ,  auntie ,  you &apos;re winning . 
are you supposed to be here ? 
are you pulling my leg ? 
oh ,  you &apos;re the understudy ,  sort of thing ? 
what are you ? 
 .  .  .  all this and a jam butty too !  ! 
at least i &apos;ve a backlog of memories ,  but all you &apos;ve got is that book ! 
ringo ,  me old scout ,  they grabbed yer leg for the iron too ,  did they ? 
hello ,  grandfather ! 
that &apos;s right; convict without trial  .  .  .  habeas corpus . 
stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him . 
no ,  that &apos;s his other one . 
how d &apos;you reckon that one out ? 
well we know that but what &apos;s he doing here ? 
aye and fond of fresh meat and all . 
give  &apos;em a pull . 
now get on with it . 
that &apos;s what you tell me . 
you &apos;re a window rattler ,  son . 
well ! 
eh ,  where &apos;s my grandfather ? 
well  .  .  . 
he &apos;s been gone a long time . 
oh ,  he &apos;s gone to my club ,  has he ? 
eh .  i thought you were looking after the old man . 
what is he ? 
oh .  .  .  god .  .  .  am i cold .  .  . 
if there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid ,  it &apos;d be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped . 
can you get it a little closer ? 
well ,  line of sight is impossible due to dust .   radar gives me noise .  sonar gives me noise .   infrared  -  -  noise .   let &apos;s try ultraviolet .   there .  flat .   it &apos;s totally flat .   a plain . 
it &apos;s .  .  .  basalt .   rock . 
can we come up ? 
just hold it< / u> ,  hold it< / u> !   computer :  have you attempted to analyze the transmission ? 
okay . 
oh  -  -  god  -  -  oh  -  - 
and then we run out of food and oxygen . 
martin ,  this is jay .   the intakes are clogged with dust .   we overheated and burned out a whole cell . 
hey ,  guess what ? 
oh it &apos;s okay .   i &apos;ve had better cag than this ,  but i &apos;ve had worse too ,  if you know what i mean . 
it &apos;s clear . 
where did it come from ? 
we can &apos;t expect to understand a life form like this .   we &apos;re out of our back yard .   things are different here . 
we don &apos;t know what might happen if we tried to kill it .   at least right now it &apos;s keeping him alive . 
we can &apos;t go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose . 
it &apos;s over ,  hunter . 
he &apos;s running a fever . 
while the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net . 
we &apos;ve got six hours left . 
the ship &apos;s gravitational attraction must have drawn him back . 
well .  .  .  now we have to herd that thing up here . 
what do you mean ,  no ? 
look at that . 
i think that &apos;s how it &apos;s getting oxygen to him . 
that must have been when he got it . 
blow the ship up ? 
first contact .  .  . 
it &apos;s close ,  real close . 
air lock ? 
oh god ,  oh god no . 
no ,  thank god .  .  .  just missed him . 
men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe .   this is an opportunity which may never come again . 
my god ,  it &apos;s stormy for a piece of rock that size ! 
source of transmission is to the northeast .  .  .  about 300 meters . 
no .   it &apos;s just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites .   if there were a native ecology ,  it would have to be microscopic . 
it &apos;s out of focus . 
atmospheric turbulence .   dust storm . 
this ship is full of cat hair . 
here ,  chaz . 
we made it !   damn ,  we made it ! 
we won &apos;t need it then . 
where are you ? 
hey ,  wait a minute !   that &apos;s all our food supplies in there !   we can &apos;t pump poison gas all over them ! 
so the only question left is :  who gets to crawl down the airshaft ? 
this is all the same creature .   we &apos;re seeing the different stages in its life - cycle . 
so what do we do ?   do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat  -  -  or do we flush it out now ? 
that was melkonis .  .  .  it ate hunter .  .  . 
headache ?   dehydration ? 
me either .   i tell you ,  i used to be with a mining outfit on callisto ,  and when something like that hits .  .  .  believe me ,  you know about it . 
it &apos;s a rhino . 
i found it .  .  . 
what &apos;s going on ? 
ah ,  quit griping .   keeps you in shape doesn &apos;t it ? 
something spooking the rhinos ? 
forget it ,  man . 
what ?   where ? 
fort powell .   what do we tell  &apos;em ? 
they knocked out the external feeds . 
communications to auto - shop go through an f . o .  link off the main trunk .  that &apos;s down with the other feeds . 
there &apos;s still time to back - out . 
see that sheathing on the suspension ?  eaten away .   same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers .   the algae out here just isn &apos;t good on these new plastics . 
hey ,  boss .   wondered where you &apos;d gotten to . 
i &apos;m serious .   that &apos;s why i switched from orbiting to planetary installations . 
what is this ?    &apos;twenty questions &apos; ? 
first light ,  we &apos;ll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back . 
yeah .   somebody won . 
do you believe him ? 
that &apos;s the wrong way ! 
they .  .  . they snapped my legs to fit .  .  .  fit me in here .   i don &apos;t .  .  . remember what happened next . 
it needn &apos;t be . 
let &apos;s have a minimum of pretending .  i &apos;ll want to do a column about you - 
suites are for expense accounts .  aren &apos;t you being extravagant ? 
addison .  .  . 
was the setting properly romantic  -  the lights on dimmers ,  gypsy violins off stage ? 
what do you take me for ? 
it is possible  -  even conceivable  -  that you &apos;ve confused me with that gang of backward children you &apos;ve been playing tricks on  -  that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them ? 
i still don &apos;t know what you &apos;re getting at .  right now i want to take my nap .  it &apos;s important that i - 
i can &apos;t believe my ears .  .  . 
your name is not eve harrington .  it is gertrude slescynski . 
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m going . 
every now and then ,  some elder statesman of the theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk .  ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings . 
that isn &apos;t a waiter ,  my dear .  that &apos;s a butler . 
you have a point .  an idiotic one ,  but a point . 
eve ,  this is an old friend of mr .  dewitt &apos;s mother  -  miss caswell ,  miss harrington .  .  .   addison ,  i &apos;ve been wanting you to meet eve for the longest time - 
margo ,  as you know ,  i have lived in the theater as a trappist monk lives in his faith .  i have no other world ,  no other life  -  and once in a great while i experience that moment of revelation for which all true believers wait and pray .  you were one .  jeanne eagels another .  .  .  paula wessely .  .  .  hayes  -  there are others ,  three or four .  eve harrington will be among them .  .  . 
bill ! 
you &apos;ve already met . 
good luck ,  genius .  .  . 
i don &apos;t want to be childish ,  i &apos;d settle for just a few years - 
knit me a muffler . 
i leave in a week  -  the picture &apos;s all wrapped up ,  we previewed last night .  .  .  those previews .  like opening out of town ,  but terrifying .  there &apos;s nothing you can do ,  you &apos;re trapped ,  you &apos;re in a tin can - 
you in a hurry ? 
she did .  .  .  ? 
when i &apos;m guest of honor ? 
well ,  we started talking ,  she wanted to know all about hollywood ,  she seemed so interested .  .  . 
i can &apos;t believe you &apos;re making this up  -  it sounds like something out of an old clyde fitch play .  .  . 
mad !  darling ,  there are certain characteristics for which you are famous  -  on stage and off .  i love you for some of them  -  and in spite of others .  i haven &apos;t let those become too important to me .  they &apos;re part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment  -  you &apos;ve got to keep your teeth sharp .  all right .  but you will not sharpen them on me  -  or on eve .  .  . 
wouldn &apos;t you feel more natural taking a bow ? 
then without feeling ,  your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn &apos;t be a shade more on the  -  shall we say ,  happier side ? 
you &apos;re being terribly tolerant ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
well ,  you needn &apos;t .  i will not be tolerated .  and i will not be plotted against ! 
it &apos;s obvious you &apos;re not a woman . 
don &apos;t be condescending . 
bill .  .  .    .  .  .  where are you going ?  to find eve ? 
it &apos;s only for the license .  there &apos;s a three - day wait  -  blood tests ,  things like that .  .  . 
a cowboy . 
hello ,  what &apos;s your name ? 
every day . 
ah .  .  . 
i &apos;ll admit i was worried when max called .  i had my doubts . 
 -  after all ,  the other day was one scene ,  the woods are full of one scene sensations .  but you did it .  with work and patience ,  you &apos;ll be a fine actress .  if that &apos;s what you want to be . 
when you told me that whatever i became ,  it would be because of you - 
 -  and for you . 
margo does not play a lunatic ,  birdie . 
you need new girdles . 
you don &apos;t like eve ,  do you ? 
she &apos;s loyal and efficient - 
who are you ? 
what are you doing here ? 
it was for my report . 
not at all . 
to speak to just a playwright &apos;s wife ?  i &apos;m the lowest form of celebrity .  .  . 
she &apos;s got to meet you - 
 .  .  .  you want to be margo &apos;s new understudy . 
the reason is margo and don &apos;t try to figure it out .  einstein couldn &apos;t . 
i don &apos;t expect you to be pleasant . 
oh ,  but there is - 
tell me .  how did your lunch turn out  -  with the man from hollywood ? 
you want to play  &quot; cora .  &quot;  you want me to tell lloyd i think you should play it . 
what  -  again ? 
i must say you can certainly tell mr .  sampson &apos;s been gone a month . 
oh ,  come now ,  as though you were an old lady .  .  .  i &apos;m on my way .  is there anything more you &apos;ve thought of -  ? 
that &apos;s my job .   see you at tea time .  .  . 
the hors d &apos;oeuvres are here .  is there anything else i can do ? 
 .  .  .  and if you &apos;d come in the middle ,  i &apos;d have stopped ,  i couldn &apos;t have gone on - 
autograph fiends !  they &apos;re not people  -  those little beast who run in packs like coyotes - 
dear birdie .  won &apos;t you sit down ,  miss worthington ? 
margo ,  nothing you &apos;ve ever done has made me as happy as your taking eve in .  .  . 
i just never think of lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down . 
why should he  -  and why should you ? 
with tears ? 
but not right away ?  first the business of fighting them off ,  chin up ,  stout fella .  .  . 
you can &apos;t put her out ,  i promised .  .  .  margo ,  you &apos;ve got to see her ,  she worships you ,  it &apos;s like something out of a book - 
lloyd ,  what happened .  .  .  ? 
we &apos;re driving out to the country tomorrow night .  just the four of us .  bill ,  margo ,  you and i .  .  . 
you &apos;ve got to admit it would be a novelty . 
margo channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years ,  half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise ! 
that bitter cynicism of yours is something you &apos;ve acquired since you left radcliffe ! 
well of all - 
three days ,  that &apos;s for the bourgeois  -  i see a midnight elopement ,  waking up a village person .  .  . 
after all ,  maybe she just wants to apologize .  .  . 
have you forgotten about eve ?  what she is ,  what she &apos;s done ? 
there you are ,  both of you .  max ,  karen has decided it &apos;s time to go . 
you disapprove of me when i &apos;m like this ,  don &apos;t you ? 
don &apos;t be evasive . 
 .  .  .  as young as they want ,  you mean .  and i &apos;m not interested in whether thousands of people think i &apos;m six or six hundred - 
very discreet .  a note right out in the open like that .  next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings  -  or tap a glass .  .  . 
i don &apos;t think i could be . 
now wait a minute ,  you &apos;re always so touchy about his plays ,  it isn &apos;t the part  -  it &apos;s a great part .  and a fine play .  but not for me anymore  -  not a foursquare ,  upright ,  downright ,  forthright married lady . 
call ,  what call ? 
play it again . 
make it bergdorf goodman .  .  .  and now everything is on its proper shelf ,  eh ,  max ?  done up in little ribbons .  i could die right now and nobody &apos;d be confused .  how about you ,  max ? 
supposed you dropped dead .  what about your inventory ? 
let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck .  it &apos;s friends that count .  and i got friends . 
i tell you what .  why don &apos;t i read with her ? 
you get quick action ,  don &apos;t you ? 
 -  - i &apos;m smart enough to know my story was solid -  - 
 -  - what do you think ?  -  - 
i hate both parties . 
how do you want to handle sloan ? 
 -  - if we could name the guys got the reports ,  we &apos;d be ahead again -  - 
now the reason no one believed the republicans is because there wasn &apos;t any reason ,  they were so far ahead .  but segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break -  in . 
i know a guy in the justice department who was around the grand jury .  
woodward ? 
look ,  you &apos;ve been jerking my chain all day .  if there &apos;s some reason you can &apos;t talk to me -  - like the fact that you &apos;ve already leaked everything to the new york times -  - just say so . 
the rest is barker &apos;s bank records .  it &apos;s mostly the eighty - nine thousand in mexican cashier &apos;s checks -  - 
i &apos;d really like to see mr .  dardis . 
tell that to muskie . 
during the florida primary ,  you wrote a letter on muskie stationery saying scoop jackson had a bastard child .  you wrote another that said hubert humphrey was out with call girls . 
 -  - he was going to go into law practice with segretti . 
what &apos;s a real denial ? 
 -  - it would have been nice to have had this ,  i sure would have liked to have had this -  - 
hannah ,  i never would have bothered you but i &apos;m off to miami and they &apos;re gonna take away my ten speed unless i get it straightened out fast . 
five hundred; six maybe . 
 -  - you don &apos;t really think you &apos;re being followed ? 
hey ,  easy .  .  . 
it &apos;s awfully hot -  -    -  - and you haven &apos;t finished telling me about the money -  - 
so tell me about the times article . 
who by ? 
that &apos;s another of the things i &apos;m not so sure of . 
we were never told flat out  &quot; don &apos;t talk .  &quot;  but the message was clear . 
right . 
 -  - if we wrote a story that said haldeman controlled the fund ?  -  - 
 -  - well shit ,  we oughtta be tense -  -  we &apos;re about to accuse mr .  haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in america of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the white house -  -    -  - it would be nice if we were right -  - 
i don &apos;t think either metropolitan or national should cover the story .   i don &apos;t think we should cover the story ,  period . 
anything else from mr .  throat ? 
mr .  rafferty was very helpful .  four cuban - americans and this other man ,  james mccord . 
what i don &apos;t understand is how you got here . 
you changed cabs ?  you &apos;re sure no one followed you ? 
why did they do all this for chrissakes ?  -  - what were they after ? 
your name ,  please . 
and the underground garage one .   would i know him ? 
you &apos;ve never told anyone who he is ?   but you &apos;d have to tell me if i asked you .   tell me . 
who &apos;s charles colson ? 
 -  - who you got ?  -  - 
 -  - listen ,  we didn &apos;t make them do these things -  - once they did ,  it &apos;s our job to report it -  - 
 -  - listen ,  i love this country ,  you think i want to bring it down ?  -  - i &apos;m not some goddamn zany ,  i was a hawk -  - 
isn &apos;t that what you &apos;d expect them to say ? 
what do you think mrs .  graham wants to see me for ? 
does  &quot; they &quot;  mean the white house ? 
no ,  it was good . 
great evening ,  isn &apos;t it ?

who are you calling ,  miss kubelik ? 
your stomach ? 
but they &apos;ll be worried about me  -  -  my brother - in - law may be calling the police  -  - 
you want me to move the television set in here ?   you play gin rummy ? 
what do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents ? 
that &apos;s me with men .  i &apos;ve been jinxed from the word go  -  -  first time i was ever kissed was in a cemetery . 
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s the explanation . 
please ,  miss kubelik ,  you got to promise me you won &apos;t do anything foolish . 
some people take ,  some people get took  -  -  and they know they &apos;re getting took  -  -  and there &apos;s nothing they can do about it . 
some weather we &apos;re having .   must be from all the meshugass at cape canaveral .   you locked out of your apartment ? 
oh ,  mr .  baxter  -  -  i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here  -  -  i was just going to get the passkey . 
i was sort of wondering what you looked like .  sit down . 
been hearing some very nice things about you  -  -  here &apos;s a report from mr .  dobisch  -  -  loyal ,  cooperative ,  resourceful  -  - 
mr .  vanderhof ,  in public relations ,  and mr .  eichelberger ,  in mortgage and loan  -  -  they &apos;d both like to have you transferred to their departments . 
what  -  -  what &apos;s that got to do with me ?  i &apos;m not running any bookie joint . 
where is your apartment ? 
how do you work it with the key ? 
where are you going ,  baxter ? 
how would you like to go tonight ? 
oh ,  yes .  thanks . 
so it was .   she threw it at me . 
you know how it is  -  -  sooner or later they all give you a bad time . 
you see a girl a couple of times a week  -  -  just for laughs  -  -  and right away she thinks you &apos;re going to divorce your wife .  i ask you  -  -  is that fair ? 
yeah .   you know ,  baxter ,  i envy you .  bachelor  -  -  all the dames you want  -  -  no headaches ,  no complications  -  - 
mr .  sheldrake ,  i &apos;ve got good news for you  -  - 
you &apos;re going to take her off my hands ? 
what &apos;s gotten into you ,  baxter ? 
now hold on ,  baxter  -  - 
baxter ? 
on account of me . 
you &apos;re on your way up ,  buddy - boy .  and you &apos;re practically out of liquor . 
well ,  lay in some vodka and some vermouth  -  -  and put my name on it . 
that kubelik  -  -  boy !   would i like to get her on a slow elevator to china . 
a lot of guys around here have tried it  -  -  all kinds of approaches  -  -  no dice .   what is she trying to prove ? 
that &apos;s okay ,  buddy - boy .   now like i was saying ,  i &apos;m in this joint on sixty - first  -  -  and i think i got lucky  -  -    -  -  she &apos;s a skater with the ice show  -  -    -  -  and i thought maybe i could bring her up for a quiet drink . 
you know ,  baxter  -  -  i &apos;m doing some research at the columbia medical center  -  -  and i wonder if you could do us a favor ? 
so you went right out and picked yourself up another dame . 
where are you moving to ? 
sorry to lose you ,  baxter . 
a night like this ,  it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment . 
can i ask you a personal question ? 
you got a girl - friend ? 
say ,  this is snugsville . 
kubelik . 
what &apos;s with you ,  fran  -  -  did you forget where you live ? 
you fool  -  -  you damn fool . 
hi .  how &apos;s the branch manager from kansas city ? 
i missed you ,  fran . 
it &apos;s been hell . 
you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like  -  -  standing next to you in that elevator ,  day after day  -  -  good morning ,  miss kubelik  -  -  good night ,  mr .  sheldrake  -  -  i &apos;m still crazy about you ,  fran . 
no .  i have a date at eight - thirty . 
i &apos;m sure .  if you &apos;ll just tell me that you still love me  -  - 
where are we going ,  jeff ?  not back to that leaky boat  -  - 
coming ? 
sorry it took me so long on the phone .  but we &apos;re all set . 
that little punk  -  -  after all i did for him !  he said i couldn &apos;t bring anybody to his apartment  -  -  especially not miss kubelik .  what &apos;s he got against you ,  anyway ? 
sylvia  -  -  sweetie  -  -  it &apos;s not that  -  -  but i promised the guy i &apos;d be out of here by eight o &apos;clock ,  positively . 
all right  -  -  i &apos;ll take you to the subway . 
a little mixup in signals .  let &apos;s go . 
but i thought you could hold your tongue . 
you came in on that boat ,  didn &apos;t you ? 
where are you headed ? 
look  -  -  you know the girls  -  -  thta &apos;s terri  -  -  she was playmate of  -  - 
well i mean like they also took our fuel  -  -  we &apos;ve been here two days . 
look  -  -  the girls could get killed  -  -  we &apos;re not supposed to be this close combat ,  i mean real combat . 
take your pick  -  -  they all like you  -  -  i can tell  -  - 
we need all our fuel anyway . 
what &apos;s there to talk about  -  -  this whole thing disgusts me . 
you &apos;re out of your skull  -  - 
we &apos;ve been attacked . 
who the hell are you ? 
how about a drink  ? 
winning the war by yourself . 
what unit were you with  ? 
rangers ,  eh ? 
a year  ?  waiter another beer . 
yeah  -  -  typical a . r . v . n . 
holy shit . 
arch light . 
chef  -  -  since you &apos;re such a fan of miss december &apos;s i think you should be detailed with lance and clean to take the first drum up there . 
that &apos;s a light down there  -  - 
who &apos;s he ? 
he killed that guy without feeling anything . 
when you kill cong ,  don &apos;t you feel something . 
yeah  -  -  fishing village  -  -  helicopters over there .  hueys ,  lots of  &apos;em . 
careful ,   captain ,  they &apos;ve been known to charge . 
can &apos;t be any worse than this .  what do you think ? 
well ,  get in there . 
two hours after the fog lifted ,  we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below kurtz &apos;s camp .  we approached a long sand - bank stretching down the middle of the river . 
who knows ?  right . 
anybody see some smoke  ? 
i never heard about that . 
jesus  -  -  that guy &apos;s too damn much . 
it &apos;s to everyone i really knew  -  -  the first girl i screwed  -  -  my brother  -  -  best friend  -  -  i wanted to tell  &apos;em how much i enjoyed knowing  &apos;em  -  -  it &apos;s been a great twenty years .  i gotta let  &apos;em know . 
how did they know ? 
this is years ago ,  before he joined special forces ,  i guess .  we had an argument . 
we don &apos;t want to bother you any ,  we  -  - 
it is very good  -  -  there is no current  -  -  it is very good .  i have never seen one like it in all indochina .  i was in paris when it arrived  -  -  do you know what might have caused  -  - 
attacks repulsed ,  as i was saying .   this is only  for this war ,  captain .  viet cong  -  -  54; north vietnamese regular forces  -  -  15; south vietnamese  -  -  28  -  -  regular forces and otherwise .   americain  -  -  6 .  of course ,  they were ,  perhaps ,  mistakes ,  captain . 
two of my men deserted last night .  it happens from time to time .  i assume my daughter told you of our conditions . 
it &apos;s an honor to meet you lance .  i &apos;ve admired your nose - riding for years  -  -  i like your cutback ,  too .  i think you have the best cutback there is . 
you smell that .   you smell that ? 
the wind  -  - 
what do you mean ? 
why the hell you wanna go up to nu mung ba for ? 
what &apos;d you do for supplies ? 
can you trust them ? 
it &apos;s gonna blow this place out .  it &apos;s gonna ruin it  .  .  . 
you were not coming here ,  to see me ? 
pain is easy to handle  -  -  but nobility .  .  the nobility of a man is judged by how much truth he can handle . 
how did we get here ? 
i &apos;ll tell you what makes sense  !  air strikes  !  white phosphorus  !  napalm  !  we &apos;ll bomb the shit out of them if they don &apos;t do what we want . 
go away  -  -  hide yourself . 
he &apos;ll kill us . 
captain  -  -  that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff ? 
what ? 
you don &apos;t know how happy that makes me ,  sir . 
oh ,  you don &apos;t talk to colonel kurtz .   you listen to him .  god ,  these are good .  i kept these people off you ,  you know .  it wasn &apos;t easy . 
may i ask where the captain is going in his little boat ? 
did you know  -  -  deeper in the jungle ,  upriver  -  -  there are savages ? 
what if i say no . 
well ,  you know i don &apos;t have the priority to do that ,  sir .  it says here not to contact com - sec -  int .  who &apos;s your commanding officer  ? 
this  -  -  bob hope or the like  -  -

a certain sonofabitch bastard  - more - 
oh . 
thanks . 
where &apos;s corbett ? 
leave it here . 
kenai at the general store asked me to bring these .   didn &apos;t expect we &apos;d already met . 
been driving long ? 
stay put ! 
still quite a hike to devil &apos;s cauldron .   days .   a long stretch to go without sleep ,  my friend .   you can hide behind that pistol for now ,  but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze  -  - 
sure love to know where you fit in up here . 
folks come to alaska for a real short list of reasons :   money .  adventure .   solitude .   those cover most everyone .   but frontiers also draw another type of man .   one with a demon in his gut .   he comes to the edge of the world to face that demon ,  and lay it to rest . 
there &apos;s a snowmobile .  inside a day we could be on the yukon .   i got money there .   remember that five thousand ?   make it ten .   be smart .   take it and walk away . 
stay still . 
what do you know about people ?  you live like an animal !   a savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here ,  as far away from the rest of us as possible . 
maybe .  .  . maybe not .   i &apos;ll tell you what scares me  -  -  stumbling through life ,  like an ordinary jerk .   that &apos;s why i want to work on the front lines ,  where what i do means something .   soon as i got here ,  i realized my job was bullshit .   oil company propaganda .   i was ready to leave ,  then i thought screw it ,  i &apos;ll outsmart them ,  do the work anyway .   i don &apos;t know anymore .   maybe i am fooling myself .   that &apos;s what i &apos;m afraid of most of all . 
can you walk ? 
how come you didn &apos;t let him shoot me ? 
hullo ,  sam .   slow day ? 
can we buy the marshal some dinner ? 
sam ,  listen  -  -  i shot to defend my man .   other guy drew first . 
will you rent me a cabin ,  or not ? 
nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that ,  correct ?   that &apos;s good .   now ,  eric ,  you &apos;re gonna hand your prisoner over to us . 
wilder &apos;s missing church services; you believe it ? 
i called the cops in fairbanks ,  see when ben is standing trial .  they don &apos;t know shit about ben or wilder ! 
you hear me ?   ben ? 
okay ,  let &apos;s backtrack ,  try to pick up his trail .   you know the kid out on the pipeline that wilder &apos;s buddies with ? 
this is sam wilder ,  marshal in devil &apos;s cauldron .   had some killings here .   i got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands . 
you &apos;re not still writing that thank - you note ? 
c - o - n - s - c - i - e - n - c - e .  i got sean from the bakery to baby - sit so let &apos;s go out . 
stop it !  !  why can &apos;t i have a normal boyfriend ?  ?  ?  why ?  get out of here .  just a regular boyfriend who doesn &apos;t go nuts on me .  .  . 
have they done skin testing for allergies ? 
do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves ? 
doc !  !  !   so listen ,  you gotta let me know about the additional costs  -  -  one way or the other we &apos;ll .  .  . 
the table &apos;s fine if it had some cholesterol on it .  two sausages ,  six bacon strips ,  fries ,  three eggs over easy and coffee . 
what &apos;s with the plastic picnic ware ?  why not try ours .  .  .   afraid it isn &apos;t clean ? 
sorry . 
you know he &apos;s a little dog .  next time ,  if bryan &apos;s not here ,  you can bring him in . 
oh ,  please .  .  . 
okay ,  pal .  .  .   i accept the compliment ,  but go easy  -  -  my knees start a - knocking when you turn on the charm full blast . 
yes ,  i do ,  as a matter of fact .  .  .  and to prove it i have not gotten personal and you have .  why aren &apos;t you at work ?  you &apos;re not sick  -  -  you don &apos;t look sick .  .  .  just very tired and bitter . 
why did yo do this for me ? 
you waiting for me to say something ?   what sort of thing do you want ?  look ,  i &apos;ll be at the restaurant tomorrow . 
so you &apos;ll be at work ? 
nice of you .  .  .  thank you . 
the stiff one eye ? 
melvin ,  i &apos;d rather not . 
are you saying accepting your help obligates me !  ? 
there &apos;s .  .  .  there &apos;s no need to bring anything dressy .  .  .  or .  .  .  i mean  -  -  i didn &apos;t know if we &apos;d be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes . 
i was going to do that for you . 
i &apos;m sure ,  simon ,  they did something real off for you to feel this way .  .  .  but when it comes to your partners  -  -  or your kid  -  -  things will always be off for you unless you set it straight .  maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance . 
you don &apos;t owe me that . 
sex with simon ? 
nothing like no choice to make you feel at home . 
i should &apos;ve danced with you . 
i wasn &apos;t asleep !  ! 
boyfriend ? 
hey ,  i &apos;ve got a great compliment for you . 
we held each other .  it was better than sex .  what i need he gave me great . 
i love you .  .  .   let him take you home . 
i also regrew my beard .  .  .   but you &apos;re not interested in changes in me .  .  .  so it &apos;s like i always told you .  .  .   when it comes to people you .  .  . 
hey ,  hey .  .  .   haaa .  .  .   bad but temporary .  the nurses say it &apos;s much better than you looked three weeks ago .  .  .   the hand will come back .  .  .   they &apos;re sure .  .  . 
how could you do that ?  he &apos;ll hurt him . 
no touch .  no touch .  no touch . 
police !  police !  fucking crooked police .  .  .   doughnut - munching morons help me !   assault and battery and you &apos;re black . 
yeah ,  but it &apos;s all about simon now .  .  .  you helped with the dog .  .  .  and now there are other things .  i &apos;m just as concerned as you are about simon . 
frank loves you .  you know that .  .  .  but i &apos;ve spoken to him and he feels that  -  -    -  -  as a businessman ,  with limited resources .  .  . 
my dog .  .  .  you know .  .  .  i mean my little dog with the adorable face .  .  .  don &apos;t you know what my dog looks like ? 
frank sachs  -  -  melvin udall . 
did you .  .  .  do something to him ? 
that &apos;s some face they left hanging on you .  you look like .  .  . 
if you &apos;ll excuse me i &apos;m not feeling so well . 
please ,  just leave . 
well ,  i &apos;ll do one thing for you that might cheer you up . 
i haven &apos;t been sleeping .  i haven &apos;t been clear or felt like myself .  i &apos;m in trouble .  some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back .  .  .   but the tiredness  -  -  boy .  .  .   not just sleepy . 
that &apos;s very thoughtful . 
well ,  i always painted .  always .  and my mother always encouraged it .  she was sort of fabulous about it actually .  .  .  and she used to .  .  .  i was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it .  .  .  and she was very natural .  she used to pose nude for me .  .  .  and i thought or assumed my father was aware of it . 
do you ever get an erection for a woman ? 
you going to come talk to me or not ? 
what did she say ? 
okay .  .  .  you tell me why  -  -    &quot; you &apos;re dying here .  &quot; 
did you like it that much ? 
then get in your jammies and i &apos;ll read you a story .  .  .  i think you &apos;ve got a chance .  the only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically  -  -  the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever  -  -  so go catch her off -  guard . 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
exactly what is your previous experience ? 
nothing .  i just watch till something strikes me .  do anything you think of  -  -  try different thing .  until i say ,   &quot; hold that pose .  &quot;  then just try and comfortably hold it . 
why are you doing this ? 
not too good at small talk ,  eh ? 
robert bain ,  driving me !   jesus fucking christ ! 
what are you doing ? 
did you see how i did that ?   magic wasn &apos;t it ? 
such language in front of a lady . 
how in the fuck do you know that ? 
where have you been ,  robert ? 
how did he know ? 
i give a fuck ?   i &apos;m done !   i quit !  do you fucking hear me !   i &apos;m fucking gone ! 
nikita ?   she helped me find you . 
took a guess .   lucky for you ,  i guessed right . 
you &apos;re one of them ,  aren &apos;t you ?   a fucking pro . 
nikita ? 
you don &apos;t know that  -  -  you &apos;re trying to scare me . 
listen  -  -  i don &apos;t even know your name . 
the same way everyone does; the government ,  the agency . 
more or less . 
my first take ? 
why ? 
did it ever bother james bond ? 
this is fiction !   don &apos;t you see that ?   this is another reality .   and the people that come into the world to play this game  -  -  nobody forces them !   they &apos;re here ,  they know the rules ,  the stakes ,  the risks !   do you understand what i am saying ?   no one is innocent  -  -  including you ! 
it .   tell it .   for all i know it could be a machine . 
that &apos;s where he &apos;ll be . 
but you &apos;ve never figured out a way to win . 
i &apos;m kind of tired .   i think i &apos;d like to try and get some sleep . 
really ? 
i paid a lot for these . 
it &apos;s too late now .   okay ?   we &apos;ll have to deal with these . 
what ? 
i don &apos;t believe that . 
ten years later ,  here you are again . 
do you have ulcers ? 
did you think they were newlyweds ? 
it was no big deal .   i saw them leave ,  i went in . 
i know .   it makes me crazy . 
what are you doing ? 
why ?   i don &apos;t know . 
did you  -  - 
was she the only one ? 
four minutes . 
wait until he is on the stairs . 
do you ever think about starting over ? 
thank you . 
how much farther ? 
funny ,  i &apos;ve never been a talker .  my wife was always getting on me about that .    &apos;say what you feel ,  tell me what &apos;s bothering you ,  you ve got to talk to me .  &apos;  i never would though .   not really . 
you &apos;re pretty famous aren &apos;t you ? 
so how &apos;s your work ? 
sounds cool .  .  .  .  . do you think he &apos;s serious about squatting a place ? 
well ,  he sure seems fired up all of a sudden . 
inspirations a fickle thing ,  you don &apos;t realise you had it till it &apos;s gone . 
what about that squat bar you showed me ,  is that open on a sunday ? 
fifteen crowns . 
oh yeah ,  what &apos;s that ? 
like custer huh ? 
okay ,  we &apos;re listening .  but i &apos;m with katka on this one . 
puppet theatre ,  don &apos;t you need something a little bigger ? 
and put it on expenses ? 
wow !  .  .  .  . what have you been doing ,  rolling around in it ? 
yeah ,  that was honza &apos;s idea ,  i had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear . 
well ,  it &apos;s definitely there  -  we &apos;ve just got to get to it . 
i thought you were gonna throw these ? 
destroy the evidence huh . 
let &apos;s split . 
so why didn &apos;t we ? 
no ,  not if you &apos;ve got better things to do . 
red or white ? 
no ,  we aren &apos;t going to do it . 
and a tram hit you ? 
what happened to katka ? 
a fine specimen for conversion . 
shit no ,  it &apos;ll be twice cost . 
do you want me to see what &apos;s on them ? 
what do you want me to do ? 
god ,  i think i need a holiday . 
in return for doug &apos;s freedom ,  i was never to see him again ,  i had to  -  it was his only chance . 
well ,  he should be on his way back to his apartment by now . 
now  -  your name is douglas greenwell ,  yes ? 
date of birth ,  november the fourth nineteen - sixty - two . 
well ,  i &apos;ll try and get that clarified .  as i understand it though ,  the charges include break and enter ,  theft ,  trespass ,  operating an unlicensed facility ,  vandalism and destruction of government documents  -  whatever possessed you to start destroying people &apos;s medical records ? 
no !  look lawrence ,  i &apos;ve taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and i &apos;m throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off .  it &apos;s going to be for alternative arts ,  but i need some help to finish it off ,  can you put the word out ? 
i &apos;d like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here .  .  .  . a weekly thing . 
why don &apos;t you read something after the break ?  doug what here ?  weren &apos;t you listening to what i just said ? 
well ,  get me and chris a drink then . 
a word of advice my celibate friend .  these czech girls look like dynamite and go like it ,  but don &apos;t be fooled; there &apos;s a price to be paid and it &apos;s going up fast .  right kat ? 
doug i can &apos;t ,  i &apos;ve got to be at work by eight .  you promised to take me home . 
i &apos;m not going in doug .  i &apos;ll wait for you here . 
she &apos;s tired . 
i don &apos;t understand ,  it &apos;s your home ? 
interesting .  do reckon i could fit through here ? 
hi ,  want to take up dancing ? 
there &apos;s three thousand crowns ,  it &apos;s all i got . 
about forty minutes . 
it is okay .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . we will paint the wood black ,  yes ? 
you mean you don &apos;t know ,  henry !  we got a bunch of anarchists ,  controlling a six - level block of luxury apartments down on janovska street here in the old town ,  and you don &apos;t know about it ? 
how do i know what &apos;s being said ? 
seems a shame ! 
what &apos;s the bugler ? 
don &apos;t you have a girlfriend ? 
did you take your things over to my place ? 
head the flyers up with asylum and then put debut of .  .  .  . psychosis ,  theatre experimental .  that &apos;ll cover us if it flops .  on the bottom put seek asylum where the stars shine on betlemska . 
good try mr .  greenwell but a little late .  we have analyzed the contents of that drum ,  the remains of the disks are there ,  just as you said . 
when the hell did you write that ? 
i decided to help out at the asylum . 
josh ! 
shall i look after the rest ? 
you are quite sure it &apos;s secure ? 
what are you an idiot ! 
no .  you &apos;re with who you should be .  it &apos;s like she chose you . 
what if they expel you ? 
out with belinda ? 
i haven &apos;t seen clay or eric lately . 
that &apos;s eight years of school and training  -  -  after college .  and all that doesn &apos;t necessarily make you a better human being . 
but if it doesn &apos;t happen ,  grab for something within reach .  life &apos;s tough enough without causing yourself disappointment  -  - 
i have no idea what to say .  how to act .  what if i do the wrong thing ? 
where is he ?  he &apos;s supposed to be here . 
don &apos;t call him a dipshit . 
and that you &apos;re scamming on jamie sullivan . 
i &apos;m very sorry  -  - 
get yourself a glass . 
i don &apos;t make small talk  -  - 
you &apos;re like this fly ,  buzzing buzzing everywhere  -  - 
that &apos;s deep  -  - 
i &apos;ll take a chance . 
because i try to be nice to people ? 
what is that ? 
looking for intelligent life ? 
like in a church painting .  i see this giant hovering over the ground .  he &apos;s wearing a robe ,  and has long flowing hair ,  and he &apos;s pointing his finger at something . 
he doesn &apos;t trust you . 
or anywhere where people might see us . 
he okay ? 
she great or what ? 
it &apos;s about working with what you already have  -  -  right now  -  -  at your fingertips  -  -  you know ,  spontaneously . 
it &apos;s places like this that make me certain there &apos;s a god . 
you make me feel .  .  . 
assholes .  this happen to you ? 
how do you know this place ? 
from here he proved to me the earth isn &apos;t flat .   on rainy days ,  we &apos;d be above the clouds . 
a thermos of hot coffee .  a blanket .  socks . 
how you doing ? 
the carter boy .  tell me about him . 
by accident  -  - 
what &apos;s landon carter up to ? 
boys like him have  -  -  expectations . 
maybe .  but that &apos;s not the real reason .  you think if i tell ,  he &apos;ll disappear and that &apos;s what you want !  me all to yourself ! 
her doctors have .  jamie and i .  we &apos;re still praying for a miracle . 
landon .  we &apos;ve lived with this for over a year now and  -  - 
i &apos;ve almost finished the rocker .  did she order mirrors ? 
you know about this stuff ? 
you &apos;ve been well ? 
i &apos;m sorry she never got her miracle . 
like you &apos;d make it to june .  even cutting half your classes ,  you have a b -  average . 
now i can do what i want . 
you could grace our hallowed halls again ,  if ,  while you &apos;re here ,  you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community  -  - 
shall i give you a few ideas ? 
your grades for fall semester .  they &apos;re  -  -  good . 
well ,  well ,  he smirked when marty opened the door .  if it isn &apos;t the neighborhood bootlegger ,  al capone mcfly ? 
this is 1952 .  .  .  .  ? 
and you never heard of rock  &apos;n roll ? 
hot tip ,   rubber biscuit in the third race at arlington . 
hi ,  marty . 
what time does school start around here ? 
george !  he &apos;s supposed to ask you to the dance ! 
hi ,  marty ! 
are you all right ,  marty ?  you seem a little .  .  . nervous . 
well ,  eileen .  .  . jeez ,  that &apos;s hard for me to say .  have you ever been in a situation where  -  -  well  -  -  you know you have to act a certain way ,  but when you get there ,  you don &apos;t know if you can go through with it ? 
how many times do i have to explain it to you ?  .  .  .  we know you &apos;re not a fighter .  you know it ,  i know it .  .  .  but she doesn &apos;t know it .  that &apos;s why we gotta make you look like a fighter ,  somebody who &apos;ll stand up for her ,  somebody who isn &apos;t chicken .  and you &apos;re not gonna look like a fighter if you can &apos;t hit me in the stomach . 
and where am i gonna be ? 
you have a name ? 
i &apos;m sorry ,  there &apos;s no answer . 
what ?  ! 
the power of a million hydrogen bombs !    .  .  . and we get twenty four measly volts .  it &apos;s not fair !  i &apos;ve been working on this power converter since 1949 ,  and you &apos;d think in all that time ,  i could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy !  but no !  thirty three years of dedication and research ,  and all i &apos;ve got to show for it is a bootleg video operation ! 
catch you later !  
the appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he !  you see ,  shemp has just become the world &apos;s first time traveller .  i &apos;ve sent shemp into the future  -  -  two minutes into the future to be exact . 
the plutonium !  that &apos;s what i came over here for !  professor ,  where did you get that stuff ? 
professor ,  you time machine works !  it works !  it sent me back in time !  i &apos;m from 1982 ! 
he will be .  simple inebriation ,  is all .  the young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol .  .  .  something that runs in the family .  you see ,  he &apos;s a second cousin of mine on my mother &apos;s side .  came quite a distance to visit me ,  he added .  his name &apos;s lewis . 
well ,  there &apos;s a mall here now  -  -  i mean ,  there will be . 
you &apos;ve convinced me that you must be who you say you are .  no living human has ever seen this machine .   but why ?  why even in my twilight years would i remotely consider sending someone back in time ? 
well ,  professor ,  are you sure you want me to tell you ?  you know ,  changing the course of history and all .  .  .  . 
4200 rads .  .  .   that certainly can &apos;t be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age . 
let me put it on a level you can understand .  you don &apos;t belong here .  you don &apos;t know anything about this world .  you don &apos;t know the customs ,  you don &apos;t know how to talk ,  how to act  -  -  you don &apos;t even look like you belong here .  and if you walked out on the street ,  you wouldn &apos;t get 100 yards without being arrested .  then there would be questions ,  and where would we come up with the answers ? 
an atomic bomb . 
i am serious .  if we could get you ,  the time machine ,  and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast ,  we could send you back to the future . 
i don &apos;t recall ever seeing it before . 
apparently ,  what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother &apos;s emotional behavior . 
look .  i &apos;m a little worried about this  -  -  this whole thing with my mother ,  he admitted to the professor .  i mean ,  i don &apos;t know if i can do it  -  -  i mean ,  hitting on my own mother ,  that &apos;s pretty heavy . 
thanks for everything ,  pro . 
but if you didn &apos;t rebuild the time machine ,  how did i go back in time in the first place ? 
what theater was i at ? 
no .  .  .  you go in there ,  i &apos;ll have to kill you .

you &apos;re a redhead . 
and the flowers .  .  .  let &apos;s not pick them .  they &apos;re so nice .

i found a lid .  it was laying on the ground over there . 
yeah ,  you look tired .  .  .  listen ,  honey .  when all this is over ,  i &apos;m going to sit down and buy you a big ,  thick steak .

hi . 
sorry to barge in on you .  anybody else here besides you two ?

go back to the bus and reroute the call .

you &apos;re a welcome sight .  .  . 
anybody we know ? 
buckaroo ,  you got a minute -  -  ? 
what is this thing ?   a fighter ? 
 .  .  . where there was some kinda giant crash landing ,  a huge explosion and they fooled orson welles into covering it up !   and then they founded yoyodyne propulsion systems and hid there for .  .  . 
and they got penny !   look ! 
did you say .  .  .  &quot; peggy &quot;  ? 
nobody &apos;s a nobody .   why &apos;re you crying ?   what &apos;s wrong ?

adopted .   i should have know .  of course .  if it was a snake ,  it &apos;d bit me !

so now i &apos;m s &apos;posed to roll over like an ol &apos; bitch dog gettin &apos; ger belly scratched . 
am i ?  maybe to a schoolboy &apos;s eye .  people who know about the human heart ,  though ,  mebbe they &apos;d say ,  bill over here ,  he gives his honey love ,  and she pays him back with pity  the basest coin there is . 
barton ,  i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not a good time - 
i &apos;ll try to slip out .  if he quiets down ,  passes out .  .  .  i &apos;m afraid he thinks  well ,  he said you were a buffoon ,  barton .  he becomes irrational
i write . 
i &apos;ll jus &apos; walk on down to the pacific ,  and from there i &apos;ll .  .  .  improvise . 
goddamn voices .  .  .  drown  &apos;em ! 
don &apos;t worry about it .  it &apos;s just a b picture .  i bring it in on budget ,  they &apos;ll book it without even screening it .  life is too short .

i thought you were going to join us .  jesus ,  garland ,  you left me alone with those people . 
 .  .  . is the egg showing or what ?  ! 
well ain &apos;t that a kick in the head ! 
sure you could !   and yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man  from where they live ,  from where they trade ,  from where they fight and love and converse and  and  and .  .  .  so naturally their work suffers ,  and regresses into empty formalism and  well ,  i &apos;m spouting off again ,  but to put it in your language ,  the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill . 
ah ,  doctors .  what &apos;s he gonna tell me ?   can &apos;t trade my head in for a new one . 
thanks ,  i &apos;d invite you over to my place ,  but it &apos;s a goddamn mess .  you married ,  bart ?

she can &apos;t see you ,  right ?   in the book ,  rule number two :  the living usually won &apos;t see the dead . 
just says  &apos;won &apos;t .  &apos;  wait a minute .  here it says  &apos;the living are arrogant .  .  .  they think they &apos;ll never die ,  so they refuse to see the dead .  &apos;
adam ,  we are< / u> in hell .   i hate these people . 
but she saw< / u> us .   i could feel it . 
that guy is in our cemetery .   oh ,  adam . 
go ahead .  .  .  third time &apos;s a charm . 
honey .   let &apos;s go . 
we &apos;ve been given a gift here ,  honey .   a real live little girl .  she likes us a lot .   she needs us .  maybe that &apos;s why we died so young ,  to keep us from getting so .  .  .  attached to things< / u> .   the house ,  antiques ,  your model .   look at us .  we didn &apos;t have room for anyone . 
what .  .  .  ? 
oh ,  adam ,  don &apos;t tease her .   you never got an a in science in your life ! 
you< / u> did this ?   you carved all these little figures and houses and things ? 
we studied all day yesterday .  don &apos;t tell me .  .  . 
so< / u> you ,  the dead ,  want me ,  the< / u> undead< / u> ,  to throw the live guys  -  -  mommie ,  daddy and lolita ,  who might not mind a tumble with an older guy ,  out into the cold ?  even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump ? 
you maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife .   so what &apos;s my cut ? 
okay .   but that betelgeuse sure seemed mad . 
are you available ? 
just get some people out of our house . 
you lilly - livered bleeding hearts ! 
he &apos;s a freelance bio - exorcist .  claims to get rid of the living .  but he &apos;s a troublemaker .   he &apos;s pushy .   he &apos;s been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years . 
if i had seen a ghost at your age ,  i would have been frightened out of my wits . 
hi ,  barb !   i &apos;m glad i caught you .  i heard you were on vacation ! 
honey  -  -  today i am three hundred fifty< / u> thousand dollars ! 
mr .  and mrs .  maitland ?   i &apos;ve come for the last time .   where are you ?   barb .  .  .

i feel like we &apos;ve been at war ,  charles . 
they &apos;re probably guilty about what they did to me . 
what ? 
not a building< / u> !   that &apos;s the beauty of it .   i think i can buy the whole town< / u> .   these people don &apos;t know the value of their property ! 
lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon . 
 &apos;i &apos; will tell you what is boring .   once you cover up the wallpaper ,  knock down a few walls ,  alter the traffic patterns ,  and  -  -  perhaps  -  -  only perhaps  -  -  think about an inground pool  -  -  the place might< / u> just be livable .   what &apos;s on the third floor ? 
now ,  lydia .  .  .  favor us about your ghosts . 
yes .  are you planning on making any sort of claim against the rand &apos;s ? 
an attorney ? 
chauncey ,  there you are .  what are you doing on that leg ? 
 .  .  .  oh .    .  .  .  my god ,  i only wish that benjamin had your recuperative powers .  .  .  anyway ,  the president offered to sit in for ben at the meeting ,  quite a nice gesture ,  i felt .  he &apos;s due here soon ,  i believe . 
 .  .  .  oh ?  you &apos;ve heard ? 
why ,  that &apos;s terrific ,  chauncey . 
i would like to walk today . 
will you be leaving now ,  robert ? 
good god ,  eve  -  you &apos;ll freeze out here . 
how true .  mr .  gardiner may be a welcome change of pace . 
well ,  mr .  president .  .  .  they don &apos;t quite know what to think . 
i understand .  i &apos;ve never seen anything like this on television . 
i can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events . 
won &apos;t your injury prevent you from attending to business ,  mr .  gardiner ? 
he does .  .  .  ? 
oh ,  i see .  .  .  your mentor ,  perhaps ? 
oh ,  i like that very much . 
i &apos;ll be all right ,  chauncey you go ahead with mrs .  aubrey .  .  . 
well ,  it seems you &apos;ve been described as one of the architects of the president &apos;s speech .  and your own comments from the  &apos;this evening &apos; show are quoted side by side with the president &apos;s . 
yes . 
i feel so close to you ,  so safe with you ,  chauncey .  .  .    .  .  .  and benjamin understands that ,  dearest .  .  .  he understands and accepts my feelings for you .  .  . 
 .  .  .  come in ,  chauncey  -  please come in .  .  . 
 .  .  .  is that all you want .  .  .  ?    .  .  .  to watch me .  .  .  ? 
i &apos;m sorry to disturb you ,  mr .  gardiner ,  i know you must be very busy . 
good ,  sir .  and so ,  it seems ,  did the president  -  but we would like to have some facts; such as ,  uh .  .  .  what exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the first american financial corporation ? 
mr .  gardiner ,  i &apos;m morton hull ,  the producer of  &apos;this evening .  &apos;
do you need a doctor ?  i could call robert .  .  . 
i see . 
regretfully ,  mrs .  rand  -  i shall yield the pleasure of your company to others . 
failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells .  .  .  not a damn thing they can do about it .  oh ,  they can make me comfortable ,  prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions .  .  .  and what makes my blood boil ,  what little i have left ,  that is ,  mr .  gardiner  -  is that it &apos;s generally a young person &apos;s disease .  .  .  here i am ,  getting on in years and about to die of a young person &apos;s disease .  .  . 
i could give it some thought ,  ben ,  but my leg is very sore . 
he &apos;s a decent fellow ,  the president ,  isn &apos;t he ? 
let me feel the strength in your hand ,  chauncey .  .  .  let me feel your strength .  .  .   yes ,  that &apos;s good .  .  .  i hope ,  chauncey  -  i hope that you &apos;ll stay with eve .  .  .  take care of her ,  watch over her ,  she &apos;s a delicate flower ,  chauncey .  .  . 
watch ?  you mean just watch me ?  doing it alone ? 
sure you do !  no one reads !  .  .  .  listen ,  book publishing isn &apos;t exactly a bed of roses these days .  .  . 
mr .  chance ,  i &apos;m very pleased to meet you . 
what about money ? 
how about taxes ,  mr .  chance ,  surely you must have paid taxes ? 
this is terrible ,  sir  -   i hope you &apos;re not badly injured .  .  . 
 .  .  .  that is a very small room . 
good morning ,  louise . 
 .  .  .  i see . 
well ,  ain &apos;t that the truth .  .  . 
i &apos;m sorry to say that our time is running short ,  but before we close ,  i &apos;d like to ask one final question .  what sort of gardener ,  sir ,  would you be ? 
louise ?  .  .  .  the maid ?  .  .  .   but she should have left earlier today .  .  . 
 .  .  .  how long have you been living here ? 
 .  .  .  we shall need some proof of your having resided here ,  mr .  chance . 
 .  .  .  in the garden ? 
 .  .  .  gardiner is laconic ,  matter - of fact .  the scuttlebutt is that he &apos;s a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of first american .  but before we can do any sort of a piece on the man ,  we &apos;re going to need facts on his background .  .  .    .  .  .  kinney ,  what did you come up with ? 
 .  .  .  is it me ?  is there something i &apos;ve done ? 
i see .  clearly ,  such interest on their part is of great political significance . 
and put it through on a code red  -  i want it as soon as possible . 
what the hell are you talking about ,  kaufman ? 
ben ! 
it &apos;s so good to see you too ,  ben ,  you look terrific ! 
mr .  president ,  i &apos;d like you to meet my dear friend ,  mr .  chauncey gardiner . 
you take care too ,  bobby . 
when you say ,  i can be somebody else ,  what do you mean exactly ? 
morning . 
the great mantini doesn &apos;t need a day job . 
why &apos;d you do it ,  craig ? 
they &apos;ll understand .  besides i &apos;ve got a morning appointment tomorrow with elijah &apos;s shrink .  we &apos;re getting to the bottom of this acid stomach . 
the iguana . 
i have to go back . 
i don &apos;t know .  there &apos;s some tension between us .  i &apos;d hate to expose you to that . 
did you know that eskimos have not one ,  but fifty words for snow .  it &apos;s because they have so much of it . 
don &apos;t forget me . 
sometimes we &apos;re forced to make hard decisions .   i &apos;d like for us to stay together ,  craig .  you know ,  platonically ,  if that &apos;s possible .  i truly value our friendship . 
it was lovely being you being malkovich ,  my dear .  i &apos;d never seen the passionate side of sweet maxine before ,  or her actual tits for that matter .  if only ,  i &apos;ve been thinking to myself ,  if only i could actually feel what malkovich feels ,  rather than just see what he sees .  .  .  and then ,  dare i say it ,  if only i could control his arms ,  his legs ,  his pelvis ,  and make them do my bidding . 
maybe this is what you &apos;ve always been ,  craig ,  you just never faced it before . 
i &apos;m in love .  for the first time .  it &apos;s funny ,  but when it happens to you ,  there &apos;s no question . 
it &apos;s elijah . 
a better friend . 
it &apos;s okay ,  craig .  it all worked out ,  in an odd sort of way . 
people make mistakes . 
with all respect ,  sir ,  i discovered that portal .  its my livelihood . 
welcome to lestercorp .  may we meet your filing needs ? 
you &apos;re not like the other boys we &apos;ve had here .  granted ,  i can &apos;t understand what you &apos;re saying either ,  but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis . 
floris ,  you &apos;re very nice ,  but i &apos;m afraid im in love with somebody else .

oh ,  he &apos;s good !  great ,  actually .  i saw him do  &quot; tru &quot;  with his sixty foot robert morse puppet .  sensational .

kevin ,  i &apos;m telling you .  .  .  it was like nothing i &apos;ve .  .  . 
i think it might &apos;ve been this lotte woman talking through me .  maxine likes to call me lotte . 
i &apos;m getting divorced . 
you know i think it pays to leave juice - making to the trained professionals .  you look terrible ,  my dear . 
what ?  !  that is not allowed .  my god ,  you are supposed to be one of us .  you know you must never partake of malkovich by yourself ! 
aaaahhhh ,  the portal ! 
yes ,  hello ,  i wanted to place an ad .   hi ,  are you craig &apos;s wife ? 
hi .  have you done malkovich yet ? 
never heard of it . 
thanks so much for coming over . 
something was making me talk .  some goddamn thing was making me move .  i gotta get out of here . 
yes .  how did you know it was me ? 
i &apos;m getting better all the time . 
stay in him forever ? 
well ,  we &apos;ll have all the money in malkovich &apos;s bank account ,  plus he still gets acting work occasionally . 
yeah what ?  ! 
good - bye ,  maxine . 
i am not asking for alms ,  but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart . 
i got a delivery around here .  name of tucker . 
you saying whitefolks won .  that what you saying ? 
you can &apos;t do that ,  baby .  it ain &apos;t right .

 .  . i swallowed her blood right along with my mother &apos;s milk .  she played with me and always came to be with me whenever i needed her .  me and her waited for our daddy .  i love her .  i do .  she never hurt me .  i love my mother but i know she killed one of her own ,  and tender as she is with me ,  i &apos;m scared of her because of it .  all the time ,  i &apos;m afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own ,  could happen again .  whatever it is ,  it comes from outside this house ,  outside the yard .  so i never leave this house and i watch over the yard so it can &apos;t happen again  .  .  .  i have to keep it away from my sister .  .  . i &apos;ll protect beloved .  .  .  &apos;cause she &apos;s mine .  .  . 
you hurt me .

what is it with you people and pain ? 
what was that ? 
recognize him ? 
why do you hate us so much ? 
i agree .   we play along for now ,  we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks . 
what do you really think ? 
where were you ,  whistler ? 
put it back in park ,  blade . 
the genetic material you spliced into nomak  -  -   where did you get it ?

nope .   back then we did not . 
pretty . 
yeah ,  your little cootchie knew .

what took you so long ? 
why not ?  the future of our race runs through your bloodstream .  you &apos;ve got the best of both worlds ,  blade .  all of our strengths and none of our weaknesses . 
you &apos;re not going anywhere . 
the day walker &apos;s blood is a disparador  -  -  a trigger ,  you see ?  for lamagra &apos;s return .  one need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him .    &quot; and the sleeper will rise from the shadows anew ,  cleansing the world in a tide of blood .  &quot; 
what are you doing ?  ! 
what are you looking at ? 
looks like we hit pay - dirt .  this place is crawling with them .   see the valets over there ?  they &apos;re vampires .  so is the doorman . 
so many of them  -  -  i still can &apos;t believe they &apos;re real . 
what am i injecting you with ? 
any progress ? 
i never imagined i &apos;d be so happy to see the sun rise  -  -   it &apos;s over ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
whistler says i &apos;m building up a resistance to it . 
but you  -  -  died  -  - 
i wish you could see the world as i do .  deacon opened my eyes .  there &apos;s no turning back from that . 
curtis ,  it &apos;s three in the morning .  i &apos;m really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes . 
you haven &apos;t started in on the internal organs ? 
blade .  once again ,  our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade .  he must be destroyed . 
i see .  and what would you have us do with this  &quot; half - breed &quot;  ? 
lamagra  -  - 
there &apos;s no need for any of this .  your condition can be treated .  whistler and i were working on a cure when  -  - 
we keep in radio contact . 
i had a family once  -  -  a wife ,  three daughters .  then a drifter named deacon frost came calling one evening  -  - 
how did you escape ? 
i wouldn &apos;t go in there if i were you .  it &apos;s best to leave him alone when he &apos;s like this . 
what happened to the power ? 
 -  - and if she ever did -  - 
what happened to her ,  where did she go ? 
what ,  are you alright ? 
you killed domini ,  didn &apos;t you ,  witch ?  ? 
 -  - jamie kurth ,  jonathan edmunds -  - 
domini ? 
what &apos;re you doing there ? 
why ? 
 &apos;thought those all got stolen . 
yeah ,  so ? 
jesus . 
that &apos;s a sapling -  - this< / u> mother &apos;s got to be three hundred years old ,  minimum . 
could we take this up later -  - like indoors ,  without half the world listening ? 
you want me to scooch over next to you ? 
i think we get the gist . 
i &apos;m not going anywhere ,   &apos;til -  - 
you &apos;re gonna owe me the rest of your life ,  bud . 
i got a friend at a lab .  i could get the whole thing blown - up ,  enhanced -  - 
and let it be known -  - before we even get to burkittsville -  - it &apos;s gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie -  - for half the cost -  - 
from - the - movie - mary - brown ,  trailer park bible psycho ? 
no fucking .

by the way ,  jeffrey ,  this story isn &apos;t going to the press and i &apos;m going to ask you to consider all you &apos;ve heard strictly confidential .  do not discuss this business with anyone ,  but me ,  or other police personnel .  got it ? 
i was the same way when i was you age .  i guess that &apos;s what got me into this business . 
jeffrey ? 
because of your information i alerted internal affairs to check out detective gordon .   i had to keep on with him as if nothing was different .   he slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid frank &apos;s place . 
frank gone ? 
thank you .  honey . 
you can hit me ,  if you want to . 
hi .  can i come in ? 
no .  but you &apos;re in very big trouble .

i &apos;ve gotta go in . 
i &apos;d like to talk to you about something .

what will i say when she comes to the door ? 
now .  we &apos;ll walk over so there &apos;s no license plates and you give me at least three minutes .  i can stall if it &apos;s more ,  but i need time to find a good window  . alright ? 
okay ,  i &apos;m going ahead .  wait a minute ,  what &apos;s her name ? 
i was just about to go to the door ,  when that man did my job for me .  was it alright ?

i already know .  the  &quot; slow club .  &quot;  it &apos;s on route 7 . 
it &apos;s crazy and dangerous .  my god .  i shouldn &apos;t have told you . 
 .  i wish you wouldn &apos;t do this .   it doesn &apos;t make any sense .  let &apos;s go somewhere and have some coffee . 
i .  i don &apos;t want to see you tomorrow .  mike &apos;s coming over . 
call tomorrow .  it &apos;s okay .  good luck .  i hope you can sneak out okay .  you &apos;re going to wait until she &apos;s asleep ? 
what &apos;s with mike ? 
yeah ? 
i don &apos;t know .  i had a dream .  in fact .  the night i met you .    .  in the dream the world was dark because there weren &apos;t any robins .  you know ,  birds .  robins stood for love .  and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love .  and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference .  i guess .  until the robins come there is trouble . 
so are you .   i mean you &apos;re a neat guy .  we better get back . 
okay .  be careful . 
you were late . 
shoot . 
then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man &apos;s place . 
you didn &apos;t tell him about me ? 
it &apos;s good to see you . 
it &apos;s okay . 
my father has a gun at home . 
where &apos;s all your things ,  jeffrey ? 
what time are visiting hours ? 
hey ,  you ivy league shit .  come here ! 
hello .  uh .  my name is jeffrey beaumont .  is detective williams in ? 
would you like a piece of cake ? 
he comes over to study . 
here you are .  would anyone like coffee ? 
i don &apos;t know why we have to watch t . v . 
oh my g - d ,  how embarrassing were they ?  i wanted to shoot myself . 
what ,  and miss all the fun ?   c &apos;mon ,  not a chance .   so ,  what &apos;s the verdict ? 
you can &apos;t sell this to your friends . 
you can &apos;t sell this to your friends . 
mr .  jung ,  you &apos;re a convicted felon ,  correct ? 
really .   are you getting paid ,  mr .  jung ? 
mr .  jung ,  don &apos;t you have an agreement or understanding with the united states government in connection with your testimony in this case ? 
hmm .   i see .   will there be clothes in the suitcase ? 
you .   your responsibility is over .   you do not fly .   you are not a pilot .   you are not a distributor .   you introduced us to mr .  stevens and the use of his airplane .   that is all .   you make a percentage .   a generous one .   and you &apos;re lucky to get that . 
i know what you want .   but ,  first of all ,  are you cops ? 
because if you are ,  you have to tell me .  if not ,  it &apos;s entrapment . 
what the fuck is that ? 
if you don &apos;t mind me asking ,  what is the reason you are in this place ? 
intriguing .   i see .   would you like to know my crime ? 
oh ,  come on ,  george .   if we are to be friends ,  we must trust each other . 
what do you got there ,  diego ? 
i thought you said we were roommates .  that we should talk about everything . 
no ,  my brother . 
that &apos;s over fifty - thousand dollars profit per kilo . 
oh my g - d . 
getting it here is no problem .   trust me .   i &apos;ll fly it in myself if i have to .  what about supply ?   how much can we get ? 
you need to come down here ,  everybody meets everybody .   ho ho ho .   ha ha ha .  we do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes . 
thirty - six hours .   i can &apos;t believe it .  everything is gone in thirty - six hours . 
who ?   i need to know .   ah ,  never mind .  we &apos;ll talk about it later . 
jesus fucking christ ,  diego .   i ain &apos;t telling you .   it &apos;s just business .   now ,  shut up .   you &apos;re driving me crazy . 
i did not . 
but ,  never mind .   i am thinking we can do much together .   this problem with diego ,  the stolen car ,  the jail ,  is very silly business .   to release him from the carcel ,  it causes me much inconvenience .  the fifty kilos could have been a big problem .   and i don &apos;t like problems . 
what do i think ?   i don &apos;t want my answer to be influenced by what i want ,  so i &apos;m going to have to say i don &apos;t know . 
i want money . 
i know . 
may the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face .  .  . 
so ,  business is going good .   i &apos;ve got this import / export thing going on in miami that &apos;s been very profitable .   with my investments .  .  . 
give it to her ,  dad .   it &apos;ll make her happy . 
tell mom ,  you know .  .  . 
 .  .  . you sonofabitch .   putting on george &apos;s boots . 
i guess i kind of lost sight of things .   &quot; may the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face ,  and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars .  &quot;   love ,  george . 
what the fuck ?   is he going to walk ? 
it &apos;s oregano .   you got ripped off ,  pal .  what are you gonna do with all this ? 
figured it out . 
it &apos;s oregano .   you got ripped off ,  pal .  what are you gonna do with all this ? 
why are you smiling ? 
pablo said no ? 
no .   these are her first steps .   watch her . 
what are we going to do ?  !   what are we going to use for money ?  ! 
you should have taken better care of me ,  you know ?   you &apos;ve been away a long time .  four years .   say something . 
well ,  here i am .   see ? 
what ? 
i swear .   on my life . 
but i have a visitor . 
but i want to put her name on the list for tomorrow .   my daughter . 
you &apos;re looking at him .   we provide the plane ,  transportation cost ,  u . s .  landing spot ,  and take it to wherever you want it to go .   you provide the pick up point in south america ,  and are responsible for payment .   you assume all the bust risks .   we take sixty - five percent of all transportation fees ,  ten percent of the gross ,  plus our expenses .  this is not a negotiation ,  so if this is okay with you ,  we can talk further .   if not ,  we can forget we had this conversation . 
listen ,  americano ,  it is very nice to meet you ,  but maybe we are going too fast .   you take a little and then come back . 
so ? 
smith .   hampshire .  .  .  . 
this is bullshit ,  george .   we &apos;re never going to find anything down there . 
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re stealing a plane . 
it is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism ,  one passes to insurrection  .  .  .  as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war ,  the latter being the determining factor  .  .  . 
in indochina ,  they< / u> won . 
the questions have already been asked .  i would only like some precise answers ,  that &apos;s all  .  .  . 
what  &quot; group &quot;  ? 
let &apos;s suppose you were a spy .  in prison ,  when the nlf contacts you ,  you pretend to support the revolution ,  and then the french help you to escape  .  .  . 
even that could be a trick .  you escape ,  then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you ,  and so you are able to contact me  .  .  . 
but i haven &apos;t shot him . 
it &apos;s better to split up ,  to increase our chances .  we must change hiding places ,  and change them continually  .  .  .  in the meantime ,  we must make new contacts ,  replace our arrested brothers ,  reorganize our sections -  - 
of course .  as soon as possible . 
be careful now .  unless you know how it works ,  it &apos;s better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this  .  .  . 
it &apos;s good nobody is following us  .  .  . 
what do you think of the strike ,  ali ? 
no ,  and neither were my men . 
because they told us that we mustn &apos;t use weapons ,  now ,  when the time is right . 
good evening  .  .  .  can we pass ? 
where were we ? 
mathieu !  mathieu ,  a name  .  .  . 
why ? 
we have to find out who else would profit from marsh &apos;s death  -  -  and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal . 
here it is !   according to the old will joanne braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars . 
under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing .   since rebecca lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will ,  if she is found guilty the will is void and joanne braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated . 
what can we prove ? 
cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want . 
was the heart attack the result of natural causes ? 
did miss lawson and mr .  marsh ever argue ? 
what did they argue about ? 
that &apos;s it .   my client doesn &apos;t have to take this crap from you . 
i don &apos;t buy it and neither will a jury . 
your honor ,  this is a tape from miss lawson &apos;s answering machine .   i would like to play it now . 
your honor ,  i don &apos;t see a mr .  roston listed as a prosecution witness . 
can i go ? 
why did you come by ? 
tell the court about that ,  please . 
how did he look ? 
did mr .  marsh change his lifestyle after that ? 
it &apos;s hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is . 
she was . 
where did you meet miss lawson ? 
yes . 
i &apos;m sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked . 
dr .  wong  -  -  what type of medicine do you practice ? 
why does she come to you ? 
would you describe for the court what chinese peony root looks like ? 
what was the nature of your relationship with dr .  paley . 
what did he say ? 
what happened next ? 
what about miss lawson ? 
do you remember the date when you saw miss lawson in the bathroom ? 
and you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you ? 
 -  - and that mr .  marsh paid less attention to you ? 
dristan nasal spray . 
hi ,  joe . 
yes . 
i want you to know right now that the trial &apos;s going to be nasty .   your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud .   they &apos;re going to say that you enticed marsh  -  -  led him down a dark path . 
something like that . 
can we get out of here ? 
nothing . 
yes  -  -  she did . 
you and me  -  -  making love . 
i love you . 
i can back it up . 
if you want me to . 
can &apos;t it wait ? 
hello ?  .  .  .  hi raymond .  .  .  .  what ?  .  .  .  well ,  i was sort of planning on .  .  .  alright .  .  .  okay ,  goodbye .   that was sattler .   he thinks the d . a .  &apos;s going to file on rebecca lawson .   he wants me in the office tomorrow morning . 
how can cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults ? 
why don &apos;t you talk to him now ? 
i know . 
it &apos;s more involved than that . 
not even if they &apos;re a dork ? 
don &apos;t use language like that at the dinner table . 
yes . 
no ,  we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife .  she told me all the dirt .  i forgot how interesting things can get around here .  it was so good to see them .  the last time we visited they were in europe .  he is doing so well .  he ordered champagne .  for lunch !  i nearly died . 
michael doesn &apos;t understand .  people who make the kind of money my brother makes don &apos;t carry money on them .  they keep it all in various accounts . 
boy .  it sure has been a long time . 
my jewish friend &apos;s grandmother did . 
it &apos;s a beautiful picture of her . 
eeeww ! 
carolyn  -  -  you want these candlesticks ? 
i can &apos;t believe she never told me ?  we spoke at least once a week .  how could she do that ? 
i can &apos;t believe she &apos;s making jokes . 
not yet .  you want to go ? 
see .  money don &apos;t buy happiness .  i must say ,  she &apos;s taking it well . 
oh ,  this heat !  times like this i wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to michigan . 
no ,  no .  i just didn &apos;t sleep well .  i &apos;m not used to sleeping alone .  and this heat .  would you mind ? 
roseman bridge ? 
you just .  .  .  got off the train because it looked pretty ? 
so ,  how long you &apos;ve been living here ? 
this won &apos;t take long .  i &apos;m shooting tomorrow morning .  i just need to do some prep work . 
sure you want to keep those in the house ? 
and how long are you here for ? 
about a year and a half . 
he &apos;s very .  .  .  clean . 
is the dizziness gone ? 
oh my god .  .  .   you &apos;re blushing . 
i didn &apos;t mean that the way it sounded . 
my god .  how i &apos;d love to see that . 
francesca ? 
so what happened ? 
woman friends ,  too ? 
do you ever regret not having a family ? 
i thought that &apos;s what we were doing  -  -  asking questions . 
it &apos;s robert . 
oh . 
oh ,  i &apos;m sorry . 
i just feel like i &apos;m getting a little  .  .  .  out of control that &apos;s all .  it &apos;s kind of frightening . 
what were you like when you were younger ? 
sleep all right ? 
what are you doing ? 
no matter how i keep turning it around in my mind  -  -  it doesn &apos;t seem like the right thing . 
you feeling better franny ? 
where you going ? 
now ?  !   it &apos;s after eleven . 
 &quot; i had forgotten this .  i had somehow remembered it being more his fault ,  his decision .  then i remembered we made love in that field before we left for home .  and i remembered it was my idea .  i remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body ,  hoping he would kidnap me .  i had forgotten that too .  and i wondered ,  as i sat there .  .  .  how many other things i &apos;d forgotten .  &quot; 
think for a second .  is there someplace she said she wanted to go ? 
when did she decide this ? 
outta my way ,  boy .   cinnabar ?   i &apos;m coming ! 
your father was his best friend .   he loved jeremiah .   so he must hate him the most of all now .   he &apos;ll take his time .  but even if it is too late .   if your father is dead .   it &apos;s not over .   the door has to be closed . 
died there ?   how ? 
 .  .  . bones ol &apos; bones so mean and bad ,  whupped his mamma ,  shot his dad . 
can you take a little extended solo right about now ,  funk soul brotha ? 
where &apos;s the gangsta of love ? 
we can climb out . 
is this hell ? 
what else ?   money . 
gotta be an in - ey and gotta be smooth .  if it &apos;s ragged ,  it was picked too soon .  won &apos;t ever be ripe .   second ,  it &apos;s got to have just a little give ,  here .   at the edges .   and last ,  but not very far from least .  .  .   you gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood ,  looooong sniff . 
i want you to do something for me ,  baby . 
where are we ,  baby ? 
one simple word ,  three little letters .  yes .   that &apos;s all it &apos;s gonna take and we could move out of this dump ,  get the real deal .   big houses ,  legit business .  .  . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  momma .   maybe next time . 
no really ,  let us help .   we &apos;re new in the neighborhood ,  gonna be neighbors . 
what else does she say ? 
like right now ,  there &apos;s actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us ?   fingers rotting off ? 
lucky thing . 
cinn ? 
i can &apos;t .   not yet . 
we &apos;re here .   where the hell are you ? 
you got the cash ? 
let me see it . 
don &apos;t worry .   it &apos;s just round the corner .  halfway down that block ,  you can &apos;t miss it .   top step of the front stairs ,  there &apos;s a loose stone .   go on ,  i ain &apos;t shitting you . 
but maybe we &apos;re the ones who should be down there .   doing something .   making it better . 
why ?   why did you give a shit about the building ?   why did you care that we were there of all places ? 
you certainly traded up .    .  .  . the trophy wife .   nice lookin &apos; . 
don &apos;t shit a shitter .   our building .  what did you call it ?   his  &apos;tomb &apos; ?   we had an agreement .   you were supposed to sit on it .   not sell it  -  - 
no way man .  .  . 
i know it .   the old slaughterhouse .   hey ,  sal .   that little weasel we popped today ?   he &apos;s got something for us .   i knew he would once he thought about it . 
we didn &apos;t do nothing ,  eddie . 
that &apos;s all we did ,  steal their ride . 
i just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination . 
jimmy bones ? 
 &quot; like a heartbeat / like a love beat .  &quot;  listen to the di franco twins there .  just the plumbing or something ,  fool . 
not really to live ,  just to play . 
you sure we oughta save him ?   why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling ? 
it &apos;s not safe down there .   the fire started down there .   the whole thing could collapse . 
there wasn &apos;t any draft .   that window was closed . 
where is it ? 
no ,  gino ! 
just look at this mess i got to deal with . 
fuck !   fuck !   how did you  .  .  .   awwww goddammit ! 
that doesn &apos;t make any sense . 
got to think this through  .  .  . 
it would have been so easy to let him in as you went out . 
all right ,  johnnie ,  you want to play it this way ,  i can play it this way .  you want to know who made a mistake ,  why don &apos;t you open the case . 
fuck !   fuck !   fuck ! 
what did she do to you ? 
i saved you . 
you murdered gino ! 
holy shit ,  i don &apos;t believe it !   we &apos;ve been going crazy over here ,  gino ! 
now that &apos;s teamwork . 
caesar ,  don &apos;t .

how did you meet him ? 
isn &apos;t that what you wanted to know ?  what i did time for ? 
i &apos;m glad you did . 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
what are you afraid of ? 
because it &apos;s the truth . 
you made a choice once .   do you think you would make that same choice again ? 
all you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected ,  someone like me . 
it &apos;s in a case ,  on his desk . 
why ? 
gino marzzone . 
has caesar ever seen him ? 
where will you be ? 
there is no going back . 
i still don &apos;t see how i &apos;m going to get clean with the money in the apartment .   everyone will think i did it . 
why ? 
hey ,  caesar !   you take care of this girl ,  or i find out ! 
unbelievable .   can you believe that ,  violet ? 
johnnie ,  what did i say ? 
you shouldn &apos;t have to see this .   why don &apos;t you get out of here ?   go for a walk . 
oh my god .   was anyone hurt ? 
i will never understand it ,  mickey .  you didn &apos;t even call the police . 
we &apos;re talking about marseille .  we &apos;re talking about nykwana wombosi .  and i &apos;m asking you if this abortion in marseille has anything to do with treadstone .   was this treadstone ?

we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re into ! 
treadstone ? 
what is treadstone ? 
that &apos;s all i get ? 
you are a friend of his ? 
there was an accident .   on the motorway .   apparently ,  he was killed instantly .   really ,  i &apos;m terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this .  .  . 
his brother .   you know his brother ? 
well .  .  .   i must admit ,  when my assistant told me you were here i was ,  really  -  -  i was quite  -  -  i was surprised . 
we also thought we hadn &apos;t heard from you  -  -  we &apos;ve had a bit of a publicity nightmare ,  people have been talking .   our offices were broken into  -  -  vandalism mostly  -  -  shortly after we last spoke . 
jesus .  .  . 
just so you know ,  if you &apos;re gonna burn me on the money ,  you might as well kill me .   i was supposed to have this car back three days ago .   it &apos;s not my car . 
when you think of it ,  before the ship  -  -  before you wake up on the ship ,  what do you see ? 
well ,  this is great .   i &apos;m sick of myself and you have no idea who you are . 
okay ,  so you &apos;re a victim . 
you ever think maybe you have a family ? 
slow down .   no ,  don &apos;t stop .   just .  .  . 
look ,  you could come up .   or you could wait if you want .   i could go check it out .   you could wait . 
 -  -  what &apos;re you doing ?   -  -  jason ,  please ,  tell me what &apos;s happening !

there are some real bastards in this department who don &apos;t mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette ,  but thank god there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication .  we &apos;ve got the upper hand for the moment ,  but they &apos;re waiting for us to slip up ,  and a little slip -  up like this is just the chance they &apos;re looking for . 
what i &apos;ve got to do now is pick up tuttle ,  interrogate him at the same voltage as buttle ,  to the same meter reading to the last penny ,  and juggle the books in electrical banking .

he wants to pull that tube out .  it &apos;s pretty painful -  - that &apos;s why they keep him sedated -  - but it &apos;s a good sign . 
you married ? 
you learn to sort of block it out ,  you know ,  like cops fence off a crime scene .  but then something good will happen and everything will just glow . 
mostly .  it must be my face .  my mother always said i looked like a priest . 
i shouldn &apos;t have asked you to come . 
i heard cy coates was brought in .  he looked pretty bad . 
this is not a good time .

tell me ,  you ever think of doing anything else ? 
you &apos;re in the stomach !  let me try . 
one - three zebra .  zebra three ,  i need you .

aaach .  .  . jane .  .  .   let &apos;s take the part that has nothing to do with me .   let &apos;s let me be your most trusted friend ,  the one that gets to say awful things to you .   you know ? 
don &apos;t say anything about anything . 
anyway .   i want you to think of this as .  .  . 
all i know is that they &apos;ve got to fire a large number of people .  .  .  and they &apos;re not going by seniority .  there &apos;s a recklessness in the air .  they .  .  .

norman rockwell &apos;s enduring portrait of a homecoming< / u>  the return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war .  .  .  tearful women ,  proud men ,  excited children .   but j . d .  singer was right  -  -  his homecoming was no big deal .

the shopkeeper on 13th street won &apos;t drop the lawsuit -  - he still claims one of the lasers we fired at the jenkins gang burned down his store .  . 
boss - man ,  what were you going on about last night :   &quot; i am the law and i am the danish .  .  .  &quot; 
i don &apos;t know ,  boss ,  you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him . 
i loved you . 
how can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and .  .  . who are you ?   were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table ?   tell me !   please tell me who you are; you own me that ! 
i heard what you said ,  spooky .  i can &apos;t believe he shot you .  .  . 
oh ,  what ?   i offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it &apos;s  &quot; sexual harassment .  .  .  &quot;

lose the smile ,  mr .  good reflexes .  we were having a pretty okay time the other night -  - good food ,  good conversation -  - some catwomen show up and it &apos;s  &quot; you need cab fare ? ; i got to go to my hideout -  - oh ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  i mean  &quot; warehouse .  &quot; 
i &apos;m sorry ,  ma &apos;am ,  there are no pets allowed in the library .  .  . 
it &apos;s seeing - eye dogs ,  ma &apos;am .  if i let the cat stay ,  will you go out with me ? 
i &apos;ll take your abuse ,  but it &apos;s way too early for the sanctimonious cult of gag .  .  . 
mom ?   oh mom ,  i messed up .  .  . 
what &apos;s it like being a superhero ?   it must be frightfully exciting .  . how did you guys all get together ?

i know he &apos;s there !   he doesn &apos;t even have the balls to pick up the phone ! 
say something  .  .  . 
we have never worked a gig together but i am a firm believer in preparation .   so let &apos;s go over this again step by step . 
and stop with the directions . 
i thought you said you could handle him . 
nels ,  don &apos;t let that cop pass you . 
nels ?

i don &apos;t want to know  -  - 
oh won &apos;t i ? 
oh man .   these people mean business . 
i &apos;m with two friends now . 
what do they need her for ? 
our house always needs touching up . 
i have no right to ask for help .  i &apos;ve never thought of anybody but myself . 
they &apos;ll recognize it &apos;s not your husband . 
i might still get there first .  the lights are with me .   how would i identify the guy who shows up at the bank ? 
he &apos;s in back .   lying face down .  they haven &apos;t hurt him anymore  -  -  but he was crying .   i never heard jack cry before  -  - 
yes sir . 
she &apos;s next .   in two or three more minutes she &apos;ll be free . 
once you &apos;re in the car with me she &apos;s sure to come to us . 
rachel was terrified when i left her .   i could see it in her eyes . 
now i have  -  -  it &apos;s a long story . 
we &apos;ve almost got your husband and your daughter out .   so don &apos;t get any ideas . 
so far they &apos;re keeping their part of it . 
at least one . 
absolutely .   and topanga canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if i recall . 
yes i would .   not kill you .   but blow off a few toes ,  absolutely .  i &apos;m entitled to that as retribution .   it &apos;ll help you to remember me in years to come  -  -  every time you put on stockings .  they must have prosthetic toes by now  -  -  with little nails on them you can polish  -  - 
they &apos;ll have units blocking us up ahead . 
they did some great job of reforming you . 
developer ran out of money years back .   i &apos;d hate to think about what &apos;s living in there . 
i &apos;m handling it . 
think about what &apos;s going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per ? 
you &apos;re walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to i . d .  you . 
she &apos;s somewhat damaged in the shipping .   but nothing makeup won &apos;t cover . 
308 - 9962 .

we &apos;re waiting on you . 
it &apos;s in the process . 
count it . 
what &apos;s he doing ?   answer me ! 
who am i talking to ? 
if he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus lenore here . 
from what i can see you &apos;re a pretty fair wheelman .   there &apos;s a hairpin coming up  -  -  that &apos;s the place for it .  the cops &apos;ll plow right into you . 
yeah ? 
what does it take to kill you ? 
who were you talking to ? 
brilliant  -  -  unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away .   in which case you just warned them . 
i &apos;m in awe . 
why are you picking on me for ? 
if her kid or her old man have been harmed we &apos;ve also got nothing to talk about . 
let &apos;s have your name and address .  the government will want to send you a letter of commendation . 
that &apos;s what he said .  jimmy .

maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth .  no thanks to you .  .  .  .  what you think of the hair ? 
we had a court - martial in your absence .  they wanted to put a bullet in your head .  i pleaded for clemency .  said we should find out what happened first .  so what did happen ? 
of course .  i forgot . 
we &apos;ll be on the other side .  we &apos;ll move when you do . 
give him a cup of tea . 
yes . 
why ? 
you ok about that ? 
thank god for that . 
whoever hits him &apos;ll be hit ,  if those men are any good .  and i presume you can &apos;t get in . 
eat something ,  would you ? 
you trying to hurt my feelings ? 
but i won &apos;t .  we &apos;re more polite around these parts . 
what makes you think that ? 
they won &apos;t let him die . 
what do you know about my nature ? 
no ,  what &apos;s the funny thing ? 
didn &apos;t look like that to me .  .  . 
c &apos;mere . 
it was a job .  so i get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face . 
why ? 
i didn &apos;t . 
you liked her ? 
see if she &apos;s all right . 
i thought as a child .  but when i became a man i put away childish things .  .  . 
so if i ran now ,  there &apos;s no way i &apos;d beat you ,  is there ? 
the teddy bear ?

now dyle ,  you listen to me  -  -  my mama didn &apos;t raise no stupid children .  i know who &apos;s got the money  &apos;n i ain &apos;t disappearing till i got my share  -  -   &apos;n &apos; my share &apos;s growin &apos; a whole lot bigger ev &apos;ry day . 
it &apos;s simple .  i like what i do  -  -  i enjoy doing it .  there aren &apos;t many men who love their work as much as i do .  look around some time . 
oh ?  did they do that sort of thing way back in your day ? 
aren &apos;t you allowed to kiss back ? 
what is it ? 
it still doesn &apos;t make sense ,  but it isn &apos;t worth any quarter of a million either .  have we forgotten anything ? 
well ,  you &apos;re right there .  ten minutes ago i had a job . 
reggie  -  -  please believe me ! 
reggie  -  -  listen to me ! 
then say it . 
i &apos;m sorry  -  -  my secretary must have gone to lunch .  you are  -  -   ? 
i &apos;m not an agent ,  mrs .  lampert  -  -  i &apos;m an administrator  -  -  a desk jockey  -  -  trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under - allocated funds .  congress seems to think that all a spy needs  -  - 
mrs .  lampert ,  i &apos;m afraid you &apos;re in a great deal of danger . 
please ,  do what we ask ,  mrs .  lampert  -  -  it &apos;s your only chance . 
or a safe deposit key ,  a certified check ,  a baggage claim  -  -  you look for it ,  mrs .  lampert  -  -  i &apos;m quite sure you &apos;ll find it . 
carson ?

is that why you dragged me all the way up here  -  -  to ask me that ?  she has it  -  -  you know that . 
scobie ? 
i thought that was peter joshua . 
i &apos;m sorry i couldn &apos;t tell you the truth ,  but i had to find out your part in all this . 
there &apos;s an old riddle about two tribes of indians  -  -  the whitefeet always tell the truth and the blackfeet always lie .  so one day you meet an indian ,  you ask him if he &apos;s a truthful whitefoot or a lying blackfoot ?  he tells you he &apos;s a truthful whitefoot ,  but which one is he ? 
why not a lying blackfoot ? 
they &apos;ve got jean - louis ! 
who do you think did it  -  -  gideon ? 
i &apos;d love some ,  thanks . 
maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many  -  - 
reggie  -  -  open the door . 
the suit needs it more than i do ,  anyway . 
what do i have to do to satisfy you  -  -  become the next victim ? 
well ,  it isn &apos;t exactly the term i &apos;d have chosen ,  but i suppose it captures the spirit of the thing . 
well ,  i can &apos;t really blame you  -  -  not now . 
monsieur flix  -  -   ? 
it is called  &apos;the hawaiian blue &apos; and there are only seven left .  in 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it .

how would you like a punch in the nose ?  stop treating me like a child . 
no ,  it isn &apos;t  -  -  where &apos;s the money ? 
so they think he left it with you . 
they &apos;re only trying to scare you ,  that &apos;s all . 
charlie had no call to handling it this - a - way .  he sure didn &apos;t .  no siree . 
what is it about ? 
i hope jean - louis understands about last night  -  -  it &apos;s just not safe for him to be around me right now . 
shoot no ,  not after all these years . 
this ain &apos;t no game ,  miz lampert . 
he should .  four guys hit on me today ,  and not because they find me intellectually stimulating . 
you do ? 
yeah .  chris berringer was parked outside the window . 
what i don &apos;t understand is why they asked marliston if rod was a virgin .  they could have asked you cindy . 
i think it &apos;s funny .

and i &apos;m warning you ,  leo .   don &apos;t test me .  get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five ,  or three million people will die . 
this is it . 
this was supposed to be a .  .  . 
dennis ! 
 .  .  . to pursue a man who &apos;s stolen government proper -  .  .  . 
we gotta get help .   aw ,  fuck !   damn .

colonel ,  sir ,  who the hell is this guy ? 
thanks .  
mason ?   no ,  he &apos;s a soda - jerk drifter ,  a hamburger flipper . 
how can we ever hope to win against the trout ? 
 .  .  . without caution .  .  . 
and what if it does ? 
nope .   is there a prob -  .  .  . 
lying ?  
 .  .  . on the other end of this phone . 
negative .   negative . 
an honest living . 
how come all these new names are pasted into the plat book ? 
we worked in chinatown together . 
 &apos;course i &apos;m respectable .  i &apos;m old .  politicians ,  ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough .  i &apos;ll double whatever your fees are and i &apos;ll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find hollis &apos; girlfriend . 
yes ,  his girlfriend . 
yes .  she &apos;s disappeared ,  hasn &apos;t she ? 
wouldn &apos;t it be useful to talk to her ? 
what about her ? 
well ,  you don &apos;t look any the worse for wear ,  mr .  gittes ,  i must say .  .  .  where &apos;s the girl ?  .  .  . 
what does this mean ? 
 .  .  . the coroner &apos;s report showed mulwray had salt water in his lungs . 
haven &apos;t the faintest idea . 
and that &apos;s what you were going to do in the valley ? 
how do you do that ? 
what &apos;s that ,  curly ? 
off the alley . 
where did you get this material ? 
how do they do that ? 
you wouldn &apos;t happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman . 
or her name ? 
i don &apos;t want it anymore . 
isn &apos;t that your number ? 
yeah ,  i took  &apos;em .  so what ? 
you really think i &apos;m stupid ,  don &apos;t you ,  gittes ? 
i want the rest of the pictures . 
i know what he says . 
give you three minutes . 
mr .  gittes . 
not that mulwray ? 
mrs .  mulwray ?  .  .  .  mrs .  mulwray . 
sorry .  look ,  you sue me ,  your husband dies ,  you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato ,  and all of it quicker than wind from a duck &apos;s ass .  excuse me .  then you ask me to lie to the police . 
and you weren &apos;t the slightest bit upset about it ? 
your father is julian cross ,  isn &apos;t he ? 
is there something upsetting about my asking about your father ? 
then it was over the water department . 
that dam is a con job . 
easy ,  it &apos;s an innocent question . 
well ,  i &apos;m only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening ,  but if that &apos;s how you go about your work ,  i &apos;d say you &apos;re lucky to get through a whole day . 
what about it ? 
hollis &apos; death .  i tried to keep it from her ,  i didn &apos;t want her upset before i could make plans for her to leave . 
you know any good criminal lawyers ? 
there &apos;s no time for you to be shocked by the truth ,  mrs .  mulwray .  the coroner &apos;s report proves he was killed in salt water .  just take my word for it .  now i want to know how it happened and why .  i want to know before escobar gets here because i want to hang onto my license . 
stop it !   i &apos;ll make it easy .  you were jealous ,  you fought ,  he fell ,  hit his head .  it was an accident ,  but his girl is a witness .  you &apos;ve had to pay her off .  you don &apos;t have the stomach to harm her ,  but you &apos;ve got the money to shut her up .  yes or no ? 
i said i want the truth . 
yeah .  .  .  where are you taking her now ? 
 .  .  . where does kyo live ? 
on his day off .  get the exact address . 
sophie . 
yeah ,  sophie . 
would you mind if we took a stroll on our own ? 
can i help you ?   russ yelburton ,  deputy chief in the department . 
mind if i take one of your cards ?  in case i want to get in touch with you again . 
you ought to be more careful .  that must really smart . 
mr .  gittes ,  you &apos;re not making a bit of sense . 
i said ,  the northwest valley . 
never ? 
the l . a .  river ? 
it &apos;s bone dry ,  morty . 
i &apos;m sure he loves you ,  too .  you know the expression ,  let sleeping dogs lie ?  you &apos;re better off not knowing . 
all right ,  what &apos;s your husband &apos;s first name ? 
this type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook ,  mrs .  mulwray .  it takes time . 
no problem with me on the job . 
never heard of  &apos;em .  .  .  new owners ? 
how did they get it away from him ? 
jesus christ ,  walsh .  that &apos;s what you spent your day doing ? 
duffy ,  go over and sit on mulvihill .   jesus christ ,  i didn &apos;t tell you to bring the police department with you . 
oh ,  you know .  she was sixteen or seventeen . 
alfredo ,  did you know my father ? 
now listen to what i &apos;ve got to say .  i took up this profession when i was ten years old .  in those days there weren &apos;t these modern machines .  the films were silent .  the projectors were run by hand ,  like this ,  with a crank .  and you wound the crank all day long .  it was really rough going !  if you got tired and slowed down &apos; boom !  everything would go up in flames ! 
because i &apos;m an idiot .  how many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist ?  none !  only a jerk like me could do it .  besides i wasn &apos;t lucky .  when i was a kid there was the war !  when i grew up ,  another war !  now it &apos;s all different .  times have changed .  and you want to be a dope like me ?  huh ?  answer me ! 
yes .  i want proof . 
toto ,  are you pulling my leg or something ?  how is it possible to see this television without film ? 
you weren &apos;t expecting me ? 
do like the soldier ,  toto !  go away !  this land is cursed .   when you &apos;re here every day you feel like you &apos;re at the center of the universe ,  it seems like nothing ever changes .  then you go away ,  one year ,  two .  .  . and when you come back ,  everything &apos;s different .  the thread has broken .  you don &apos;t find those you were looking for ,  your things no longer exist .  isn &apos;t that the case ?  .  .  . you &apos;ve got to go away a long time ,  for many ,  many years ,  before coming back and finding your people again ,  the land where you were born .  .  . but not now ,  it &apos;s impossible .  now you &apos;re blinder than i am .  
thanks for all you &apos;ve done for me . 
but alfredo ,  what you &apos;re saying is horrifying ! 
no particular reason .  .  .   nice day ,  huh ?  
so what &apos;d they say ? 
no ,  salvatore .  you &apos;d better go .  it &apos;s my father . 
but i &apos;ve never forgotten you ,  elena ! 
i &apos;ve been looking for you all day .  did you buy the milk ? 
lia &apos;ll be so glad to see you ,  you &apos;ll see .  and you won &apos;t recognize the kids any more ,  they &apos;re grown up by now . 
see how pretty the house is ?  we did everything over .   if it hadn &apos;t been for you !   come ,  i have a surprise .  .  .  .   you must be tired .  if you want to rest ,  there &apos;s time before the funeral . 
the projector &apos;s all rusty ,  but i could fix it in two or three days .  give the place a good cleaning ,  put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we &apos;ll show catene in two houses . 
that &apos;s fine ,  mr .  kane . 
 &quot; miss susan alexander ,  a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur  -    -  last night opened the new chicago opera house in a performance of  -  of  -  &quot;   i can &apos;t pronounce that name ,  mr .  kane . 
let &apos;s hope they like it there . 
but please ,  mr .  kane ,  don &apos;t buy any more paintings .   nine venuses already we got ,  twenty - six virgins  -  two whole warehouses full of stuff  - 
ask them to sit down ,  mr .  bernstein . 
mr .  bernstein ,  am i a stuffed shirt ?  am i a horse - faced hypocrite ?   am i a new england school - marm ? 
if you hadn &apos;t come along and protected me when you did ,  i &apos;d have killed them fellows . 
hello ,  mr .  leland . 
i thought it would be a nice gesture  -  the new publisher  - 
you may resume your work ,  gentlemen .   i didn &apos;t know your plans and so i was unable to make any preparations . 
my little sanctum is at your disposal .  but i don &apos;t think i understand  - 
mr .  kane ,  this is a surprise ! 
hello ,  brad  - 
emily ! 
oh !  ! 
oh ! 
thanks . 
a chicken ? 
a rooster ? 
excuse me ,  mr .  kane .   i know this takes a lot of nerve ,  but  -  who are you ?   i mean  -  i &apos;m pretty ignorant ,  i guess you caught on to that  - 
would you sing for me ? 
i mean it .   oh ,  i know i always say i mean it ,  and then i don &apos;t  -  or you get me so i don &apos;t do what i say i &apos;m going to  -  but  - 
i &apos;m not just your wife ,  i &apos;m a person all by myself  -  or i ought to be .   i was once .   sometimes you get me to believing i never was . 
oh ,  i don &apos;t mean the things you &apos;ve given me  -  that don &apos;t mean anything to you .   what &apos;s the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you &apos;re going to keep crated up and never look at ?   it &apos;s only money .   it doesn &apos;t mean anything .  you &apos;re not really giving anything that belongs to you ,  that you care about . 
well ,  i &apos;m not going to stop it .   i &apos;m going to say exactly what i think .   you &apos;ve never given me anything .   you &apos;ve tried to buy me into giving you something .   you &apos;re  -    -  it &apos;s like you were bribing me !   that &apos;s what it &apos;s been from the first moment i met you .   no matter how much it cost you  -  your time ,  your money  -  that &apos;s what you &apos;ve done with everybody you &apos;ve ever known .   tried to bribe them ! 
you &apos;re talking an incredible amount of nonsense ,  susan .   whatever i do  -   i do  -  because i love you . 
you &apos;ll never have another chance to hit me again .   i never knew till this minute  - 
let &apos;s not start all over again ,  charlie .   we &apos;ve said everything that can be said . 
you see !   there hasn &apos;t been a true word  - 
is mrs .  kane  -  
close the door ,  raymond . 
oh ,  yes ,  sir . 
no ,  i don &apos;t ,  mr .  kane . 
say ,  brad .   i &apos;ve got an idea . 
yes ? 
there are the people of the united states ,  and they are blaming you  -  oh ,  i know it doesn &apos;t make any sense ,  but at least you can learn a lesson from it . 
i &apos;m drunk . 
i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ll do ,  brad  -  i &apos;ll get drunk ,  too  -  maybe that &apos;ll help . 
i don &apos;t think so ,  brad .   we &apos;ve just had word that the president is out of danger .   it seems i didn &apos;t kill him after all . 
maybe we &apos;d better wait for more word on the president &apos;s condition . 
you &apos;re going to live with mr .  thatcher from now on ,  charlie !   you &apos;re going to be rich .   your ma figures  -  that is ,  er  -  she and i have decided that this isn &apos;t the place for you to grow up in .  you &apos;ll probably be the richest man in america someday and you ought to  - 
brief marriage !   ten years !  
i don &apos;t know .   he was disappointed in the world .   so he built one of his own  -   an absolute monarchy  -   it was something bigger than an opera house anyway  -   nurse !   say ,  i &apos;ll tell you one thing you can do for me ,  young fellow . 
on your way out ,  stop at a cigar store ,  will you ,  and send me up a couple of cigars ? 
i know ,  but  - 
that &apos;s the whole works ,  right up to date . 
i did a lot of singing after that .  i sang for charlie  -   i sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour  -  the teachers got that ,  i didn &apos;t  - 
he was in love with me .   but he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us  -  and he lost the election and that norton woman divorced him . 
in case you &apos;ve never heard of how i lost all my money  -  and it was plenty ,  believe me  - 
they haven &apos;t been tough on me .   i just lost my money .   but when i compare these last ten years with the twenty i spent with him  - 
i &apos;ll come down in a week or so and see her again .   say ,  you might be able to help me .   when she used to talk about kane  -  did she ever happen to say anything  -  about rosebud ? 
are you sure ? 
i &apos;d say you &apos;re about nineteen ,  twenty ,  am i right ? 
that &apos;s your lung .  by this time ,  your lung looks like this . 
thanks .  have a good one . 
if you &apos;re going to drink it in here ,  i &apos;d appreciate it if you &apos;d not bother the customers . 
like i &apos;m responsible for all the smokers ! 
she said not to come home until graduation . 
a woman &apos;s intuition .  something in me says it &apos;s time to give the old boy a serious try . 
dick . 
hey caitlin .  .  .   break his heart again this time ,  and i &apos;ll kill you .  nothing personal . 
territoriality .  he was mine first . 
it &apos;s not what you think . 
well .  .  .  kind of ,  sort of ? 
i would &apos;ve told you ,  and you would have stopped calling ,  like a baby . 
the last thing i needed was for you to think i was hiding something from you . 
you don &apos;t have anything to do with it . 
you mean ,  on a date ? 
i offer you my body and you offer me semantics ?  he &apos;s just a boyfriend ,  dante ,  and in case you haven &apos;t gotten the drift of why i came all the way here from ohio ,  i &apos;m about to become single again .   and yes - let me placate your ego - you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision ,  for which i &apos;ll probably be ostracized at both school and home .  you ask me who i choose ,  i choose you . 
yeah ,  right .  who was it :  randal ? 
wait a second ?  who was working here today ? 
then who operated the store ? 
well he asked me for it ! 
pack of cigarettes .   congratulations .  i saw that announcement in today &apos;s paper .   she &apos;s marrying an asian design major .

the quest isn &apos;t going well ? 
it &apos;s not like you laid the eggs yourself . 
did you ever notice all the prices end in nine ?  damn ,  that &apos;s eerie . 
think of the weirdest ,  craziest shit you &apos;d like to see chicks do .   these chicks do it all .  they insert things into any opening in their body .  .  .  any opening .   he &apos;s led a very sheltered life . 
i &apos;m gonna hear it tomorrow . 
it &apos;s not really anyone per se ,  it &apos;s more of separate groupings . 
so ,  what - you &apos;re stuck here all day ? 
because you buckled . 
what happened to all the gatorade ? 
after an exhausting game like that i can believe it . 
number six . 
you hardly knew her !

what the fuck did you do that for ? 
you don &apos;t know what you want ,  but i &apos;m not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out !  i &apos;ve encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school ,  to take charge of your life and find direction .  i even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if i was with you .  everyone said it was a stupid move ,  but i didn &apos;t care because i loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you &apos;ve been in since that whore dumped you ,  oh so many years ago .  and now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more ? 
you hold the counter and i &apos;ll pull .

the fat man on cherry street .   the other fat man ,  mr .  bulldozer .   the trumpet player .   that leaves two . 
remember that thing a few years back ?  that thing with the cab ? 
something big &apos;s going down ,  and i &apos;m betting the feds don &apos;t know about it .  you gotta get us in there . 
 .  .  . if they &apos;re wrong ?  ! 
i &apos;m standing right here . 
how am i supposed to not get excited ,  listening to you trying to extort your employee ,  you sarcastic prick ? 
max ?   maaax .   pick up ,  dipshit . 
uh ,  let &apos;s go to .  .  .   hello .  .  .  ? 
it &apos;s home . 
you know ,  this is the cleanest cab i &apos;ve ever been in .   this your regular ride ? 
why not ? 
regulations ?   these guys don &apos;t even give you sick leave .   how much you pull down on a good night ? 
we have a deal .   what &apos;s your name ? 
good .   help me out here . 
how about the thingy next to it ? 
music . 
i should only kill people after i get to know  &apos;em ?   six billion people on the planet ,  you &apos;re getting bent out of shape  &apos;cause of one fat guy ? 
i don &apos;t know any rwandans . 
that one &apos;s probably married .   think of his kids .   his wife &apos;s pregnant .  .  . 
who &apos;s that ? 
don &apos;t take that .   tell him to shut the fuck up . 
i had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes .   where &apos;s the button ?   under the dash ? 
vincent ? 
you &apos;re the one who keeps talking about going with the flow .   you like the man ,  you like the way he plays .   how about a little jazz ,  huh ? 
let &apos;s go . 
show up for what ? 
guy with a routine goes and breaks it ?  provokes attention .   that &apos;s bad .   and that &apos;s not good .  .  . 
don &apos;t be .   i never saw him after i was 15 .   went into the military early .   so all this talk about  &quot; my job &apos;s temporary ,  i got big plans ,  &quot;  it &apos;s all bullshit . 
in case he asks . 
as in .  .  .  ?  
slow down ! 
love gives you wings .   it makes you fly .   i don &apos;t even call it love .   i call it geronimo . 
i was only going one way . 
sure .   and the two of  &apos;em used my legs for a wishbone .   nearly snapped me in half . 
how long have we known each other ,  jerry ? 
well that &apos;s the eye right there .  money< / u> .   and all the power and misery it brings with it .  it &apos;s a plot to take over the world .   the master conspiracy .  can take a lifetime to pull off . 
shoot . 
i didn &apos;t mean for you to see it .  it &apos;s like looking in someone &apos;s diary and taking it out of context .   know what i mean ? 
i &apos;ll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now . 
johnny dancer ,  right ?   you don &apos;t ride him anymore ,  do you ?   not since your dad died . 
never mind .   you &apos;d think i was making it up . 
maybe you better not try .  .  .  i worked so hard to keep quiet .  like a mouse .   i should have realized . 
and you think group one is at war with group two . 
they don &apos;t break in the summer !  do you know what building is right over this spot ?   harriman tower .  their sub - basement was flooded !  he didn &apos;t die in a pool .   call the coroner in rhode island !   ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated ! 
you will ? 
i don &apos;t know what to say .   i love you . 
yeah .  .  .   would you ,  i mean ,  could you love me then ?   if i was normal .   maybe ? 
i don &apos;t .   i know you wouldn &apos;t . 
we &apos;re going to queens ? 
now what ? 
at a horse show . 
blue moon .  .  .  blue moon .  .  . 
they changed franklin &apos;s portrait . 
i &apos;m a very patient man . 
you made your decision yet ? 
that &apos;s not what i mean .   i want to see her . 
and you have no idea where he lives ? 
here &apos;s a fresh one .   why you ?  your colleague mr .  wilson says jerry won &apos;t speak to anyone else .  that seems oddly possessive behavior to me . 
veritas .   truth .   what is it they say about truth ? 
i didn &apos;t know the c . i . a .  had psychiatrists . 
brain washing ,  mind control ,  that sort of thing ? 
me ?   i was a minor missionary ,  a heretic really .   but where else could a red - blooded american boy lie ,  cheat ,  steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the all - highs ?   besides ,  now i &apos;m trying to pay my penance . 
night after that ? 
liza ,  settle a bet for us . 
the office is closed for the evening .  is this an emergency ? 
ah ,  your psychotic is here . 
tell him i &apos;m on vacation .   that i won &apos;t be back for two weeks . 
i &apos;ve had a lot of credentials flashed in my face ,  liza .   what i saw yesterday ,  i know not to ask questions .   we &apos;re out .   shut off .  terminated .   understood< / u> ? 
guy &apos;s a c . i . a .  shrink .   here to i . d .  fletcher .   they knew each other somehow . 
when i &apos;m ready to compare notes ,  i &apos;ll let you know . 
who &apos;s the deputy director of the f . b . i .  ? 
what ? 
there &apos;s no plug to pull . 
you don &apos;t believe it to be .  .  .  tell me something ,  doctor .   why do you think they would go to all this trouble .  .  .  bring you tens of thousands of light years ,  and then send you home without a shred of proof ?   sort of bad form ,  wouldn &apos;t you say ?   what was their intent ? 
what in the hell .  .  .  ? 
i &apos;m sorry ,  miss arroway ,  not only is it too speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation ,  at this point in your career it &apos;d be tantamount to suicide . 
pepsi ?   tequila ? 
ellie .  .  . 
ellie ,  i should have done this a long time ago ,  certainly before i left the n . s . f .  ,  but i wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt  -  - 
it &apos;s not like you &apos;ve given me much choice . 
mathematics is the only truly universal language ,  senator .   we think this may be a beacon  -  -  an announcement to get our attention . 
ms .  president ,  this is communist paranoia right out of war of the worlds .   there is no reason whatsoever to believe the etis intentions are hostile .   we pose no threat to them  -  -  it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in africa . 
you mean  -  - 
david  -  - 
david .  .  .  i know we &apos;ve had our differences .  .  .  but i &apos;ve always thought of you as a fair man ,  even when we &apos;ve disagreed  -  -  and it &apos;s in that light i &apos;m hoping you &apos;ll consider my request .  .  . 
you aren &apos;t staying ? 
what ? 
got a bogey ,  boss ? 
here ,  right around centaurus a . 
 .  .  .  i don &apos;t understand it .   all i can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn &apos;t accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design . 
i don &apos;t have the figures in front of me ,  but yes ,  that sounds about right . 
talk to him . 
pensacola . 
time to sleep now ,  captain .   but you can ask more questions in the morning ,  okay ? 
but you &apos;re so .  .  .  i mean how could you possibly .  .  .  ?   when i was unconscious .   you .  .  .  downloaded .  .  .  my thoughts ,  my memories ,  even .  .  .   this beach .   i &apos;ve never been here but i remember .  .  .  it &apos;s how i always imagined .  .  .   pensacola . 
why did you contact us ? 
the scale .  .  .  it &apos;s just .  .  .   so all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here ? 
am i one .  .  .  or many ? 
eventually you &apos;ll get here on your own .   this was just the first step; in time you &apos;ll take another . 
what kind of deal ? 
page after page of data  -  -  over sixty - three thousand in all ,  if i &apos;m not mistaken .  .  .  and at the end of each .  .  . 
a machine .   but a machine that does what ? 
a sunrise and a sunset every forty -  five minutes . 
i &apos;d say this is slightly different . 
i thought you were here because you want to go . 
it &apos;s like the pre - copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the earth ,  or the victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made .   i mean .  .  .  try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us  -  -  then imagine trying to explain .  .  .  i dunno ,  a microwave oven  -  -  to someone even a hundred years ago  -  -  i mean the basic concepts didn &apos;t exist .  .  . 
 .  .  .  i keep telling myself okay ,  that &apos;s just the price ,  you have to do your time doing shitwork before you &apos;re allowed to get to the good stuff .  .  .  but if i have to catalog one more quasar .  .  .   god ,  i &apos;ve missed you . 
the v . l . a .  ? 
it &apos;s good to see you ,  ellie . 
someone tell me this is really happening . 
thank god .   when we lost contact ,  i thought  -  -  we thought .  .  .  but you &apos;re okay .   we &apos;re still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction .   did you notice anything at all that  -  - 
that &apos;s not doubt .   that &apos;s four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct .   i always wondered what you religious types did with your free time . 
do you love your parents ? 
did you love him ? 
i was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors . 
what ? 
i &apos;m in love with you ,  ellie . 
do you really think your life is meaningless ,  eleanor ?   is that why you &apos;re so quick to risk it  -  -  because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose ? 
i don &apos;t have any proof ,  palmer . 
it &apos;s not enough ,  don &apos;t you understand ?   i know it happened  -  -  but by every standard of science ,  by every standard i &apos;ve lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point .   it may be true but it doesn &apos;t matter because i can &apos;t prove it &apos;s real . 
i want to ,  palmer  -  -  more than anything .   but it has to be real .  it has to be true . 
i &apos;m not sure .  .  .   maybe it simply exists in the search for it .   maybe its something we have to make for ourselves . 
you kill me ,  you really do .   the first truly global ,  a - political event in history and you can &apos;t wait to spin it . 
i guess i &apos;d say i trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of ,  thanks for the advice ,  but no thanks .   but to dilute or censor the truth ,  for whatever reason  -  - 
oh my god .  .  . 
 .  .  .  as have all attempts at internal analysis .   we &apos;ve tried sonargrams ,  magnetic resonance ,  gamma rays; it &apos;s completely impenetrable . 
i don &apos;t think you understand .  we made a deal  -  -  - 
well ,  arletta ,  i got to stand down here . 
you allus had good jobs ,  and that girl in kentucky i taken a shine to her . 
i &apos;m leavin &apos; the place to john .

dragline ,  lemme look at the picture . 
oh we got our sources .  .  .  tearing the heads off .  .  .  what was it .  .  .  gumball machines ?  what kind of thing is that for a grown man ? 
whatta you so happy about ? 
maybe he &apos;s been chain - ganging too long . 
shut your mouth  &apos;bout my lucille . 
they don &apos;t know iff &apos;n to smile ,  spit or swallow . 
damn ,  luke .  what &apos;s the matter with you ?  what &apos;s the matter with me ?

i don &apos;t see no sign of guts in you . 
excuse me ,  but would you mind explaining why you &apos;re watching the lady upstairs ? 
i hate this .  .  . 
i got it myself .  .  .  i couldn &apos;t wait . 
he can &apos;t phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you .   did you give him an approval ? 
but earlier ,  he was staring up here .   please< / u> ,  andy . 
i want to die . 
investigators halloran and goetz .   i apologize for goetz ,  he &apos;s a firehouse dog . 
are you staying long ?   shall i shut the door ?   make your coffee ?   make the beds ? 
no ,  that &apos;s still in my jacket i was wearing .   we were supposed to meet on the docks ,  that number 47 wharf ,  10 o &apos;clock friday .   he &apos;s gonna hand me 500 bucks . 
hello ,  daryll lee . 
i think whatever is best for you ,  daryll .   and maybe you &apos;re right ,  that &apos;s the place . 
how was conrad supposed to find kurten ? 
you like that action ?   didn &apos;t that cop on tv look solemn< / u> ?   the guy in the basement doesn &apos;t matter ,  anyway ,  just another lonely heart . 
because of your phone calls . 
it was a lover or a husband .  someone close .   somebody who knew her and cared about her . 
why imitate a dead serial killer ? 
how do you know that ? 
we &apos;ll show that to .  .  . 
we &apos;ve got another one . 
but it &apos;s a different m . o . 
he comes in the window ,  we maybe grab him .   where &apos;s the on - switch ? 
there were needle marks .   but no drugs in her blood . 
he &apos;ll get caught .   if he has a plan that &apos;ll be what trips him up .  .  . 
what &apos;s that siren ? 
they weren &apos;t going to show it to me ?  !   the arrogance !   it &apos;s my life< / u> ! 
i just thought it was so  -  -  unprofessional .   of you both ! 
a man ?   i thought he was a boy .   this last christmas was the happiest christmas i had in the last ten years .  .  .  you know why ?   it was the first christmas in six years i was not in love .   son of a bitch married men< / u> !   who cares about marriage ,  the bed just gets crowded and noisy ?  ! 
yes .   dahmer !   and after that .  .  . 
i am not going to talk about it .  how do you know< / u> it was andy if the head was gone ?   where is the head ?  are you looking for it ?   oh ,  god ,  why him ?   because of me .   i can &apos;t talk about it .   i write about things like this ,  stuff it all in books and bury it in libraries .  this is the first person close to me who &apos;s ever died .   and it &apos;s because of me .   this monster killed him because i loved him . 
why can &apos;t i drive home ?   i will .  you .   look at you .   you< / u> need a ride home .   and you don &apos;t even know it . 
that computer &apos;s wired into internet . 
yes . 
you take it ,  hang on to it ,  it &apos;ll make you feel safer .   stay put . 
i was . 
what am i wasting my time with this shit for ? 
i heard .  good police work . 
i like women like that ! 
you messed with the scene . 
how about i put nikko on it ? 
you ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women &apos;s lib ? 
where you going ? 
you want mine ,  too ?   you take his ,  you take mine .   i &apos;m the one fucked it up .  .  . 
that was bundy .   he killed forty of them ,  identical ,  long hair ,  parted in the middle ,  alike as barbie dolls .    .  .  . this is hopeless .   let &apos;s try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and tv hookups and broadcast a warning ? 
poor darling .   what can i do about karen ?  how can i arrange to have her seduce me ?  she desperately needs a conquest . 
not a lot of action here . 
if i groundloop during my flying lesson on saturday you might wake up and find me next to you . 
i &apos;ve never really noticed .  is renata going with you ? 
i &apos;m amazed that she &apos;ll let you drive her . 
he must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his .  it &apos;s like a bed on wheels .  it must smell of semen .  .  . 
i thought that was you ,  up there . 
the traffic .  .  .  where is everyone ?  they &apos;ve all gone away . 
do you want a cigarette ?  i started to smoke at the hospital .  it &apos;s rather stupid of me . 
and you had sex with all of these men in cars ?  only in cars ? 
really ?  what kind of exhibition is it ? 
why are the police taking this all so seriously ? 
i need to see you ,  ballard .  i need to talk to you about the project . 
patient . 
the question ,  letty ,  is how are you feeling ? 
i don &apos;t need a lecture .    i care about michael . 
but what i really can &apos;t believe is that i &apos;m starting to actually miss work . 
so ,  we &apos;ll meet every tuesday and friday .  and if you have any kind of emergency ,  you can page me . 
it was just a little going - away gesture . 
how ? 
oh ,  wait a minute ,  now i see where you &apos;re going . 
what about this one ? 
really ? 
go on ,  letty .  i want to see it on you . 
letty ,  dinner &apos;s almost ready .    the souffle .  .  . 
that settles it .  i &apos;m never leaving . 
you did the right thing . 
i &apos;ve talked to doctor emlee ,  and he says .  .  . 
if you feel lonely ,  or need to talk ,  all you have to do is say so . 
let me shift gears here a minute .  .  .   do you ever hear voices that other people don &apos;t hear or see things they don &apos;t ? 
stop acting like you &apos;re someone special .  you &apos;re just like the rest of us . 
was it bad news -  - the visit from peter ? 
thanks .     where &apos;ve you been all day ? 
what &apos;s my rap ? 
why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors ?  that &apos;s no way for us to break up . 
then it &apos;s over . 
john and nurse gates are waiting for you . 
well ? 
tell me all . 
hey . 
the store was busy . 
would you mind if we just called it an early night ? 
four interviews .  four no - gos . 
silly ?    silly am i ? 
i guess we need to talk . 
i &apos;m sorry .      i didn &apos;t come here to blame you . 
forget i asked . 
no ,  i can &apos;t .  i &apos;ve already convinced both mom and dad to come . 
you know what i think we need ?  martinis .  how about martinis to celebrate ? 
i hope it wasn &apos;t something i did . 
of course not ,  no .   is that why you &apos;re here ? 
no ,  you &apos;ve done a perfect job . 
what &apos;s so urgent ?    you &apos;ve got me worried . 
you &apos;re going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney - tune that you misguidedly think is love ? 
how &apos;s work going ?     are you back at school ? 
what ? 
no .  you killed her .  manager remembers you going into her room .  your fingerprints were found all over the place . 
what about me ?  aren &apos;t i a loose end ? 
zero .    that &apos;s all i know . 
who ? 
where &apos;s your brother ? 
thank you marcel ,  for that .  .  .  extremely redundant explanation . 
daniel .  listen i &apos;m afraid there has been a big -  - 
good .  i &apos;m doing good .  how you doin &apos; ,  frankie ? 
and ? 
and for my help i would get what ? 
i only ask so i can call you when the arrangements are made . 
this plane will take you to canada .  from there you can fly back to paris . 
tonight ? 
i don &apos;t know . 
not a good idea .  someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you .  raymond ,  you &apos;ll steal one . 
yeah .    we just go home . 
forget the money !  we &apos;ve got bigger problems than the money right now . 
why not just steal another one ? 
we are being watched .  daniel grabs the binoculars and looks . 
do they come with batteries ? 
did you know about bastaldi &apos;s deal with zammito ? 
i &apos;m not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you &apos;re testing mine . 
hadley  -  - 
it &apos;s not your fault ,  daniel . 
and ,  uh ,  i &apos;m going to have to charge you a commission .  .  .  kind of like a brokerage fee . 
yeah ? 
hey you guys are becoming famous .       i was just watching the news and -  - 
we had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime . 
okay ,  we &apos;re square now ,  right ? 
hey boss ,  it &apos;s not a science . 
yeah ,  french guys from france . 
well ,  you know ,  when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night ,  stick guns in my face ,  tie me up and steal from me .  .  .  it does irritate me . 
you know why i &apos;m handling it very well ?  because you &apos;re going to get these guys for me . 
if i knew where they were you wouldn &apos;t have to find them ,  would you ? 
what hotel ? 
the map said to go left . 
what do we do ? 
no ,  i didn &apos;t . 
yes . 
i knew this was a mistake !  i knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this .  i could hear that little voice in my head saying ,   &quot; don &apos;t do it !  don &apos;t you do it !  &quot;  jesus ,  why don &apos;t i ever listen to myself ? 
maybe i &apos;m missing the obvious ,  but why aren &apos;t we leaving town ?  any place has to be safer for us than chicago . 
a black panther was a member of an african american militant group in the sixties ,  marcel .  i think you &apos;re referring to the pink panther . 
c &apos;mon ,  i look more like elvis than you do . 
this is great .  after everything we &apos;ve been through we &apos;ve got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball . 
anybody know about that car outside ? 
fuck you ,  grease - ball ! 
yeah . 
how are we going to do that ? 
the new beaujolais &apos; come out in france next week .  you like wine ? 
you put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs ?  how stupid is that ? 
i wasn &apos;t expecting this many of you .  i &apos;ve got a few sleeping bags you can use . 
when do we go ? 
who &apos;s gonna see it there ? 
i &apos;m sorry things went so wrong today . 
i really thought we had something special going .  i can &apos;t tell you what a disappointment you &apos;ve turned out to be . 
jesus ,  frankie ,  i &apos;m your brother ! 
oh really ?  thanks .  i thought it was a sewing machine .  what the hell is it doing here ? 
who are you ? 
i &apos;m looking for someone .   jade fox .  i &apos;m a police inspector from shaan xi ,  gen su district .   jade fox is a master criminal .   i hear she infiltrated the yus .   she must have come with them when they transferred here .   but with yu &apos;s reputation ,  i can &apos;t just go in and accuse her . 
do you think you are a real master ? 
you wouldn &apos;t have understood ,  even if i had tried to explain .   you know .  .  .  you &apos;ve gone as far as you can go .   i hid my skills so as not to hurt you . 
hello .   what is your name ? 
you don &apos;t seem to understand . 
i &apos;ve missed you . 
take my horse and go to the compound .  give this to mrs .  wu .   she &apos;ll help you .   hurry ! 
you &apos;ve got quite a temper .   it &apos;s better this way . 
go . 
monk zheng said you were at wudan mountain .   he said you were practicing deep meditation . 
no ,  i &apos;d already sent them home .  you can blame me for losing the sword ,  but please trust that i &apos;ll get it back soon using my own methods . 
what do you mean ?   didn &apos;t you come back here for it ? 
you did your job well .   but ,  this girl .  .  .  i saw her last night . 
that &apos;s not for her .   she should come to wudan and become a disciple . 
they &apos;re gone . 
you &apos;ve always been so good to li mu bai and me .   please accept our thanks . 
please ,  sir te ,  what is it ? 
we must be careful .   governor yu is a court official ,  and in charge of security .   any disturbance will cast suspicion on him .   it might get sir te in trouble . 
what in the hell .  .  .  do you call that ? 
could be . 
well ,  hello there .  .  . chocolate , 
are you nuts ,  walking into a gun ? 
you okay ,  man ?   i mean ,  what just happened . 
thank you .   for giving a damn . 
mom  -  -  ? 
i was wonderin &apos; where you &apos;d gotten to  -  -   oh ,  elly ,  honey ,  a cat .   here ? 
hey ,  darla  -  -  before we die of old age ,  how about it  -  -  ? 
it &apos;s just the dope ,  don &apos;t worry
i can pick out a tune now and again .

well ,  how &apos;s your friend ? 
chili dog for breakfast .  .  .  it &apos;s original . 
a year ago .   halloween .   a man and a woman .   in a loft .   you helped to murder them . 
you want those assholes ,  you want top dollar . 
i believe our friend elly call you mister crow .   please acknowledge; the mike will pick you up . 
i wish to possess what you have now . 
what the hell are you ?

all i have to do is look at amy &apos;s eyes ,  blue and deep like yours . 
no .   it &apos;s not that .   it &apos;s because i know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves  -  -  imagine things .  i love amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals .  i saw what happened to irena with her cat people .

waiter !  she needs more water . 
no way is that the same chick .  the other one was a dog . 
no one i &apos;ve run into knows what  &quot; coyote ugly &quot;  means . 
a dog at victoria &apos;s secret ? 
that bite healed up quickly .  it &apos;s been about three weeks ?

he &apos;s a very talented musician . 
sorry .  it &apos;s just so bad lately .  you &apos;re so lucky you never get pms . 
why did gregory ask me out ?  i mean he &apos;s cute  -  -  he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea . 
he &apos;s dead ?  am i bad luck or what ? 
and he was ripped limb from limb ? 
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?  you said you hadn &apos;t seen him for a month . 
how &apos;d it go with the cop ? 
no he didn &apos;t .  come on ,  i don &apos;t want to be alone with those two .  all they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me . 
charming carlton . 
and what makes you think you killed a man ? 
get rid of him ! 
holy shit ,  i don &apos;t know . 
what happened to his tooth ? 
don &apos;t call the police . 
there &apos;s kind of this guy i &apos;m seeing . 
symptoms include loss of emotional control ,  compulsive behavior ,  cravings ,  crying spells .  .  . 
this is from a scientist in france ,  madame sconce .   &quot; the original werewolves were females .  they became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman &apos;s cycle .  my suspicion is that the only cure is true love .  &quot; 
she died at age 34 in the 1800 &apos;s .  they thought she was crazy .  she was banished from her town .  seems her husband shot her . 
i &apos;m cleaning my stove . 
i &apos;m just afraid i &apos;ll hurt peter .  i think i love him . 
no .  i can &apos;t take that chance .  i &apos;d rather kill myself . 
i think george knows . 
i know . 
i do development for tv movies . 
man i &apos;m starving too ,  i think i &apos;ll go for the surf and turf . 
so there i was ,  hanging from the edge of a bridge ,  when my mom said ,   &quot; son ,  you got into harvard !  &quot;  it took three of them to pull me back !  frida keeps eating . 
no .  really ,  i &apos;m .  .  .  i don &apos;t feel well .  i &apos;ve got terrible pms . 
you &apos;re just saying that to get into my apartment and then you &apos;re hoping that &apos;ll turn into something else . 
ouch that stings !  damn ,  what am i going to do with my back like this ? 
where &apos;d you get the bike ? 
these guys aren &apos;t the kind that &apos;ll take an apology .  they &apos;re the kind that &apos;ll break my thumbs . 
the nielson &apos;s ? 
oh ,  it &apos;s nothing . 
what are those ? 
what are they for ? 
i mean we can still .  .  .  whatever .  .  .  maybe i should get a towel ? 
oh my god ,  you scared the shit out of me .  you following me again ? 
you sure ?  it &apos;s my favorite shirt ,  mind if i check ? 
speaking of mark  -  -  we &apos;ve tried to track him down and there &apos;s no sight of him .  vanished into thin air .  i got a hunch he fled the country . 
is it that funny ? 
you know ,  i &apos;ve never seen your cat . 
yes ,  sort of .  i mean no ,  not really . 
yes ,  your pms .  frida i can deal with that . 
we can work this out .  other couples have worse problems . 
you say you killed a man and don &apos;t remember it .  couldn &apos;t you have had sex and not remember it ?  it &apos;s sexual .  why did you choose  &quot; eating him &quot;  as the method of killing ? 
a kiss ?  did you have sex with him ? 
you heard about carlton fraser ? 
no he &apos;s not .  he &apos;s a courier .  he picks up packages from the airport . 
so i asked the bartender what  &quot; coyote ugly &quot;  meant .  it &apos;s like the  &quot; bagger &quot;  system .  you know ,  a two -  bagger  -  -  someone so ugly that you need two bags  -  -  one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off .  or a three - bagger .  .  . 
he was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time . 
come on ,  i &apos;ve been working with frida .  carlton won &apos;t even recognize her now .  she &apos;s really coming out of her shell . 
jesus christ she got her period .  relax guys .  it happens . 
maybe .  what about all those hairs they found on his body ? 
she &apos;s got a hidden pitbull .  maybe she hired someone to kill them . 
it &apos;s like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes . 
so .  .  .  they &apos;re on some cycle .  the murders .  .  .  gregory .  .  .  then 28 days later .  .  .  carlton . 
the city .   i need to get to the ocean . 
how long have you been here ? 
police .   nobody move . 
i met a friend of yours the other night ,  doctor .   tall fellow .   no hair .   rather pale skin .  .  . 
that &apos;s surprising .   he was leaving your office at the time .  .  . 
dammit ! 
ive taken the liberty and had inspector thompsons office searched ,  as i believe you instructed .   all clear now ,  sir .   they found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories .  .  .  poor man . 
that was a pretty good escape act at the station .   how did you do that ? 
they &apos;ve taken my mind ,  my memories .  .  . 
but .  .  .   how long has this been happening ? 
a book of delusions .   anything else ? 
i didn &apos;t realise .  .  .

you mean we get `dave &apos; to nominate you as vice president . 
nobody &apos;s got clean kids . 
okay ,  let &apos;s see .  .  .  you can have him on tuesday the 25th .  .  . 
when does it break ? 
it &apos;s not his job  -  -  it &apos;s my job ! 
uh - oh .  .  . 
you sure ?   a coke or a perrier or something ? 
now ,  dave ,  something has come up and i think we need to talk about it .  .  . 
what happened ? 
it &apos;s actually kind of serious ,  dave .  i &apos;m afraid the president &apos;s not in very good shape . 
will he be alright ? 
now ,   let &apos;s say the whole country .  was in that car .    the entire united states of america . 
now some of this may feel a bit strange at first .   you gotta remember that even a professional politician has some trouble getting used to .  .  . 
the teleprompter .   is it hooked up ? 
gimme a quarter . 
`dave &apos; ? 
now he &apos;s making stuff up about me . 
yes ,  but i wouldn &apos;t .  .  . 
what are they ? 
so you just protect the president the whole time ?    that &apos;s your whole job ? 
i was waiting for that jack . 
what are you staring at ? 
you bet . 
i care about the homeless . 
look .   if there was some mistake .  .  . 
oh .  .  .  yeah .

i lock at you and i see bill .  .  .   i mean ,  he &apos;s almost dead ,  but he &apos;s right here .  .  .  i mean ,  you &apos;re right here .  .  .  alive and .  .  . 
you know ,  dave  -  -  it is dave ,  isn &apos;t it ?   i can &apos;t keep all of this a secret . 
it was okay ? 
i know .  i &apos;m sorry .  .  . 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
so this is it ? 
did you get someone to double for me there ,  out front ? 
try to find someone who looks like me this time .   that last guy was a joke .

are you kidding ?   he &apos;d kill me ! 
well ,  if it &apos;s more than a whim ,  then you &apos;ll have to prove that to him .   you &apos;ll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it &apos;s what you really want to do .   if that doesn &apos;t work ,  at least by then you &apos;ll be eighteen and able to do what you want . 
you really think i should forget her ?

okay  -  -  you know what you do ?   you produce a film in a commercially proven genre .   and after it &apos;s a hit ,  you take the profits from that< / u> ,  and make the twelve apostles &apos; movies . 
and perfect .   cut ! 
mr .  reynolds !

mr .  weiss ,  i was thinkin &apos; about what you said ,  about how all your movies have to make a profit .   and i realized ,  what &apos;s the one thing ,  that if you put in a movie ,  it &apos;ll be successful ?  ? 
isn &apos;t he dead ? 
and what &apos;s with this new title ?  !   my poster says  &quot; i changed my sex &quot;  !

hell ,  i &apos;ve seen a lot worse reviews .  i &apos;ve seen ones where they didn &apos;t even like the costumes !   like ,  that last  &quot; francis the mule &quot;  picture  -  -  it got terrible< / u> notices .   but it was a huge hit . 
just like i always promised .   now you &apos;re among the immortals .   you &apos;re movie stars . 
you &apos;re sure this is gonna work ? 
i suppose .   it &apos;s very expensive .

good morning ,  mr .  mcallister . 
could you approve them now ?   i &apos;d like to kick off my campaign right away ,  you know ,  in the morning . 
thanks for everything . 
okay .  that &apos;s good .  i just wanted to make sure . 
i guess you know why you &apos;re here
i agree .   but i also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very ,  very grateful the whole school didn &apos;t find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations ,  and chances to win certain elections . 
act surprised .  walk slowly to the podium .   be modest .   thank them for this incredible honor . 
so ,  are you looking for something sporty or more practical ? 
plenty of pep ,  too . 
why are you doing this ? 
coming to see me .   are you trying to .   .  humiliate me ? 
that little bitch made a fool of us i want her out of the election .  getting everybody all riled up like that .   she &apos;s finished ,  you hear me ?  washed up . 
life would go on ,  and i would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience . 
looks at her skeptically  doesn &apos;t say a word . 
and when did you do it ? 
could you get this ?  i can &apos;t
hey yeah ? 
three twenty - five . 
we made a mistake .   let &apos;s not make it worse . 
paul ,  what &apos;s your favorite fruit ? 
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard . 
oh ,  no .   no .   i &apos;m just finishing up here ,  and i &apos;ve got to get home . 
she &apos;s doing this to get back at me
so mr .  mcallister asked you to run . 
paul ,  i just want you to know that no matter how this turns out ,  you &apos;ve run a wonderful campaign .  it &apos;s been fun competing with you . 
i saw you fight kid gavilan .   i like your style . 
i don &apos;t know . 
it doesn &apos;t matter .   all they get is veronica lake .   you got the real lynn margaret bracken .  .  .   where &apos;d this come from ? 
so you saved her . 
lad ,  may i have a word with you ? 
does that paper say we &apos;ve been indicted ?   does it say exley &apos;s a hero for squealing me and stensland off ? 
how what ,  wendell ? 
give me one minute . 
that &apos;s him .   that &apos;s him . 
was it .  .  .  a rat ? 
i knew stensland and meeks knew each other .   meeks was with sue lefferts on christmas eve .   the night i met lynn .   lefferts &apos; mother i . d . ed stensland as lefferts &apos; boyfriend ,  but stens pretended he didn &apos;t know either one of them . 
dudley &apos;s guys . 
it all keeps coming back to dudley . 
richard stensland . 
officer white .   how about susan lefferts ?   you know her ? 
you wanna go downtown and discuss this officially ? 
wendell white ,  how &apos;s tricks ,  paesano< / u> ? 
i don &apos;t know if you read the papers ,  but that case is closed . 
whose shoe ? 
ray ,  you protected ty and larry up in casitas ,  didn &apos;t you ? 
what do you mean deuce perkins got clipped last night ?  ! 
and ? 
you &apos;ll reap the benefits ,  but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department ? 
you remember buzz meeks ,  dudley ? 
twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with dick stensland .   they arrested a pierce patchett on an extortion scam .   guy ran hookers .  he &apos;d have them photographed with their johns ,  then double - dip for some blackmail .   charges got dropped .   insufficient evidence .  you were supervising officer on the case and i was wondering if you remember anything about it . 
i should &apos;ve known .   what &apos;s the chief throwing you ? 
damnit .  .  .  what< / u> ? 
even i &apos;m not that crazy . 
it &apos;s a simple question . 
what &apos;s that for ? 
high line whores .   with plastic surgery to look like movie stars .  and who knows what else ?   it &apos;s run by this guy pierce patchett .   you want to talk to him ? 
we got a dead ex - cop and a girl who looks like rita hayworth at the nite owl .   another dead ex - cop under the house of rita &apos;s mother .  it &apos;s not a good week for ex - cops . 
really ?   what did white say ? 
it galls you that i know so much about you .   you don &apos;t have information to compete . 
i &apos;ll take your word for it . 
does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier ? 
you don &apos;t like that you don &apos;t know how to play him .   he doesn &apos;t follow the same rules of politics you do .   that makes him dangerous . 
where will you go ? 
they &apos;re sitting in the dark ,  goofing on the christmas tree . 
no .   but i &apos;ve got something going with ad vice . 
loew didn &apos;t go with him .   you &apos;re sure ? 
have we met before ? 
fleaur - de - lis .    &apos;whatever you desire .  &apos;
brill ? 
depinto &apos;s dead . 
i don &apos;t know anything about zavitz . 
i just gave him my card . 
i don &apos;t want any money .  and believe me ,  i have no interest in ruining your life .  i &apos;m not interested in this tape . 
zavitz ,  what ?  you want your old job back ? 
tired of chasing squirrels around the park ? 
lemme ask you something .  i put a bird feeder out in the yard ,  but the squirrels ,  they keep taking -  - 
you &apos;ve got it on tape ? 
you knew the deal .  no contact . 
why don &apos;t they just identify themselves and tell me what they want ? 
what if i find out what they &apos;re after .  you know these people ,  i don &apos;t . 
i taped it off the 11 o &apos;clock news . 
the price rises with the temperature and right now you &apos;re smokin &apos; .  but you &apos;re right ,  you should shop around and get the best price .  i &apos;ll just let you out here . 
jesus ! 
the nsa &apos;s been in bed with the entire tele - communications industry since the 40 &apos;s .  they &apos;ve infected everything :  banks ,  computers ,  phones ,  mail ,  name it .   the more technology we buy into ,  the easier it is keeping tabs on us .  it &apos;s a brave new world .   at least it better be . 
i intercepted phone calls . 
that was twenty years ago .  with digital ?  they can suck a salt grain off a beach . 
what do you think ? 
gimme that . 
we lost  &apos;em . 
i was thinkin &apos; about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits . 
if they couldn &apos;t do that ,  they &apos;d shut down the whole system ,  all the relays . 
feeling lucky ? 
well ,  sir ,  i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not as simple as that .  your average newspaper guy or hard copy lady or whatever ,  they can &apos;t buy this stuff . 
i yanked this off your rv .  it &apos;s a global positioning tracker . 
how  &apos;bout christian dior ? 
very good . 
for that matter ,  i think you will too . 
because my life is being ruined . 
witnesses said you were there ,  but i notice you didn &apos;t file a report . 
anything at all ? 
uh - oh . 
you should take this seriously . 
you &apos;re a lawyer .  don &apos;t you care what &apos;s going on around you ? 
bobby ?

why the hell would i -  - 
how &apos;s the trout ?

robert -  - 
well until we find ,  you &apos;re gonna have to take a leave of absence . 
i don &apos;t under -  - 
robert -  - 
she doesn &apos;t want to talk to you . 
who won the fight ? 
yeah . 
they took the espresso machine .  the espresso< / i> machine ,  jerry !  which makes sense ,  you know ,  because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo . 
why don &apos;t you give  &apos;em a call . 
what ? 
jerry -  - 
tell me about it . 
what is it you want ? 
what ? 
the originals ? 
am i to understand -  - 
and they have the video .  that &apos;s confirmed . 
not yet .  he &apos;s near  &quot; m &quot;  and 34th .  i &apos;ve got an elsur unit on the scene now .  a residential building .  twelve units . 
we &apos;re not stupid ,  reynolds . 
yes ? 
now is that clear ? 
daskylus
they don &apos;t see foreign women in this market .   how much did you pay ? 
a mountain curved like a woman &apos;s back ,  a plateau the shape of an ear . 
this is not very good ,  is it ? 
madox knows ,  i think .   he &apos;s tried to warn me .   he keeps talking about anna karenina .   i think it &apos;s his idea of a man - to - man chat .   its my idea of a man - to - man chat . 
of course .   you didn &apos;t need to slap my face to make me feel as if you &apos;d slapped my face . 
i just know  -  any minute he &apos;ll find out ,  we &apos;ll barge into somebody we &apos;ll  -  and it will ill him . 
what ?   what ?   that boy ,  that little boy ,  you were holding his collar ,  gripping his collar ,  what for ? 
why did he bring you ? 
i &apos;m sorry ,  katharine . 
a broken car ? 
uxoriousness  -  that &apos;s my favorite kind of love .   excessive love of one &apos;s wife . 
what kind of photographs ? 
safe journey . 
i think the desert is ,  it &apos;s  -  for a woman  -  it &apos;s very tough ,  i wonder if it &apos;s not too much for her . 
yes ,  of course .   so ,  golly ,  where have you come from ? 
if i could just see some identification . 
and i &apos;m telling you there &apos;s nothing there to explore . 
when &apos;s clifton picking you up ? 
how are you ? 
david caravaggio . 
is this you ? 
it is you .   this was taken in cairo at british headquarters  -  july 41 .  and so was this  -  august 41 .   and this  - february 42 . 
no . 
it &apos;s a week .   we didn &apos;t know where you were  -  or if you coming back ,  or  - 
i told her you would never invent such a preposterous name . 
why do you think ?   about my staying ? 
oh . 
darling ,  i just heard .   you poor sausage ,  are you all right ? 
sweetheart ,  you know we can &apos;t go home ,  there might be a war . 
i will hide you in the room where we sleep ,  said candaules .  she stumbles over the word . 
there &apos;s a man downstairs .   he brought us eggs .   he might stay . 
they have to clear all the local roads of mines .   that &apos;s a big job .  they won &apos;t stay in the house .  they &apos;re putting up their tent in the garden . 
who knows the bosphorus hug ? 
you don &apos;t have any money ,  do you ?  just in case there &apos;s silk . 
i &apos;m not sewing anything else for you ! 
where &apos;s your stuart from ?  somewhere near there ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
excuse me .   yes ?   i don &apos;t have the key to that door . 
try this .   i found a great jar of it .  olive oil .   in naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife . 
you must get away .   before i cut .  i &apos;m not cutting if you &apos;re here .  he &apos;s struggling .   he &apos;s going to topple over if he cuts . 
this is hot ! 
the war &apos;s over  -  you told me yourself .  how can it be desertion ? 
i was looking for the lieutenant singh . 
i &apos;ve got a surprise .   a boat !   we can go to capri .   it &apos;s got a cabin ,  it &apos;s private . 
you should sit down ,  darling .   she &apos;s quite all right .   are you pregnant ? 
you tell me .   i remember a lot of things .  i remember a garden ,  plunging down to the sea  -  the devil &apos;s chimney we called it  -  and there was a cottage at the bottom ,  right on the shore ,  nothing between you and france . 
so he popped the pane ? 
you don &apos;t call ,  you don &apos;t write . 
in the middle ?  you &apos;ve got the mask ,  why don &apos;t we have him ? 
tell me where you are ,  or just leave the line open so i can trace you . 
why are we speaking chinese ? 
i &apos;m sorry about the scroll ,  but sometimes you have to lose to win . 
believe me ,  if you weren &apos;t so tiresome ,  i &apos;d have one for you . 
you have a car ? 
are you .  .  . okay ? 
i don &apos;t care about the damned car .  my luggage &apos;s been stolen . 
do you mind ? 
and i thought we were getting on so well . 
i know . 
it &apos;s a test . 
how much am i paying ? 
he says they turned the card down . 
what about your bags ? 
and -  - 
we ?  are you implying that i &apos;m taking you inside ? 
i wondered who &apos;d been giving me a bad name . 
the rembrandt -  - that was quite good . 
so the mask is part of the down payment too .  must be a really big job . 
so you &apos;re testing me< / u> now ? 
you were afraid of heights ? 
and -  - 
camera in the -  - 
stop !  you &apos;re making .  .  . mistake . 
the big job . 
your share . 
if you want a partner ,  i think you should recalculate the split . 
the mask .  where is it ? 
the eight billion .  from them to us . 
peoples china bank . 
you &apos;re out of your mind .  we can &apos;t do a job like this with no rehearsal . 
of course not .  it was just a negotiating ploy . 
i &apos;m going to disappear .  i die in a car crash in taiwan .  very easy to do . 
relax ,  don &apos;t jam it .  .  . 
hang on . 
what &apos;s wrong . 
you have the right to remain silent .  but anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you -  - 
 -  - you &apos;re a cop . 
they &apos;ve been on to you all along .  knew you had a big job going . 
a true master .  classic ,  yet extremely sexual ,  don &apos;t you think ? 
always in a rush . 
i said a masked ball ,  not a costume party . 
so patience ,  thibeau ,  patience .  trust me . 
you better not be taking on a new partner . 
this is just show and tell . 
takes a lot out of you ,  one like this . 
 .  .  .  what we do in here is keep track of all the case files .   that way ,  at any time ,  we can find out a case &apos;s status  -  -  where it is in the office ,  stuff like that .   we file  &apos;em all here ,  alphabetically  -  - 
anna ?   with this real - estate valuing stuff  -   -  could you remind me ,  cause i &apos;m a little confused about how exactly we do that . 
um ,  erin ?   listen .   even though you &apos;re not necessarily my favorite person in the world  .  .  .    .  .  .  sometimes you &apos;re not half - bad . 
mr .  masry ,  before you go off on some crusade ,  you might want to remember who it is you &apos;re dealing with here .   pg&e is a 28 -  billion dollar corporation . 
whoa .   remind me . 
fax these to this number ,  okay ? 
jesus . 
i added air conditioning ,  put in the pool ,  made all those pillows by hand  .  .  . 
thank you .   it &apos;s in remission now ,  thank the lord ,  but you never know .   and then while that &apos;s going on ,  i end up having to have a hysterectomy .   plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts .   all benign so far ,  but still ,  no matter how positive you stay ,  an operation can still take it out of you . 
are you kidding ?   with how our lives are ,  if i start subdividing files ,  i &apos;ll be sunk .   i just kept all pg&e correspondence in one place . 
cause of the chromium . 
what &apos;s chromium ? 
i can put them in a good school . 
oh ,  please ,  it was long over by then .   god damn ,  he made me look like some cheap  -  - 
okay ,  look .   if you really want to apply for a job here ,  you can do it the way everyone else does .   send in a rsum ,  make an  -  - 
give her a cold washcloth to suck on  -  -   i gotta go  -  -  there &apos;s a clean one in that bag  -  -  i &apos;ll check back in a bit .   sorry .   my kid  -  - 
out to lunch with the girls . 
okay ,  enough  -  -   now ,  look ,  erin  -  -  this incident aside ,  i don &apos;t think this is the right place for you .  so what i &apos;m gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf .   find you something else ,  okay ? 
so what made you think it was ? 
that document you found ,  the one that says it was the bad chromium  -  -  you didn &apos;t happen to make a copy did you ? 
mr .  masry ,  mario gets lost going to the bathroom .   they &apos;ll be driving around the valley for hours . 
okay ,  so here &apos;s what i &apos;ll do .   i &apos;ll go on up to ted and rita daniels  -  -  two of the nicest people you &apos;d ever hope to meet ,  who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer  -  -  i &apos;ll tell them we can &apos;t help them cause you don &apos;t feel like working that hard . 
you think there &apos;s more ? 
don &apos;t give me that .   you &apos;re gonna get plenty rich off of this ,  mr .  40 percent .   we got those pg&e fuckers by the balls here . 
hey .   a new plaintiff called ,  wants to meet you .   i told him we &apos;d be out there thursday . 
erin ,  you &apos;re a big girl .   if you got a problem with jane ,  work it out for yourself .  i don &apos;t have time to deal with  -  - 
so what are you thinking ? 
plus ,  40 percent of 20 million &apos;s a whole lot of money . 
because that &apos;s how people treat each other< / u> ! 
people don &apos;t fly down in their own god damn plane for  &quot; just a meeting &quot;   -  - 
if you &apos;re here to fire me ,  your timing &apos;s lousy . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  are you saying that if this thing goes to trial ,  it &apos;ll be ten years< / u> before these plaintiffs see their money ? 
when ?   where ? 
the fuck i &apos;m not .   i don &apos;t care what the doctor says  -  - 
morning ! 
i don &apos;t know what to say . 
what is that ? 
two million dollars ? 
course as it turns out ,  i &apos;m not a very good employee . 
pattee ?   that your middle name ? 
you know what ,  erin ?   i got nothing but time here .   why don &apos;t you let me do that for you ,  and you can get your kids some dinner . 
what kind of chromium is it ? 
yes .   there &apos;s straight - up chromium  -  -  does all kinds of good things for the body .  there &apos;s chrom 3 ,  which is fairly benign ,  and then there &apos;s chrom 6 ,  hexavalent chromium ,  which ,  depending on the amounts ,  can be very harmful . 
hunh - uh .   what &apos;s that ? 
county water board .   all righty ,  thanks . 
put your napkins in your laps and eat up . 
mommy ,  can i get a flower ?

i &apos;m not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call ,  george .

what am i supposed to do ,  check in every two seconds ? 
well ,  look ,  there isn &apos;t a ton of information here ,  but from what there is ,  i &apos;d say that these two people here  -  -  what are their names ?   shanna and ashley ? 
soon ,  lord vader . 
you &apos;re not ready yet .   you still have much to learn . 
luke ,  i will not lose you to the emperor ,  as i lost vader . 
howls and shrugs his shoulders . 
barks his concern . 
 .  .  .  the power ? 
barks his consternation . 
okay ,  chewie ,  it &apos;s now or never . 
no ,  no !   i &apos;ll stay and help you find your friend . 
will it take long to get there ?  how far away is he ? 
thank you ,  general .   but there &apos;s a price on my head .   if i don &apos;t pay off jabba the hutt ,  i &apos;m a walking dead man . 
he doesn &apos;t make sense to me either ,  chewie . 
sir ,  i was wondering  .  .  . 
you ,  too ,  golden rod . 
it sounds like it &apos;s trying to get in . 
that bounty hunter we ran into on ord mantell changed my mind . 
he &apos;ll know when he gets back  .  .  .  don &apos;t give me that look .   every day more bounty hunters are searching for me .   if i don &apos;t pay off jabba soon ,  there &apos;ll be too many to stop  .  .  .  remotes ,  gank killers ,  and who knows what else .   i &apos;ve got to get that price off my head while i still have a head . 
you probably don &apos;t .   how could you ?   you &apos;re so terrified of your own emotions  .  .  . 
there &apos;s no accounting for taste .  believe me ,  you could use a good kiss .   you &apos;ve spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you &apos;ve never learned how to be a woman .  it &apos;s a shame ,  because you &apos;ve got all the makings for one .   i could have helped you plenty in that department  .  .  .  if you &apos;d have let go for a minute .   but it &apos;s too late now ,  sweetheart .   your big opportunity is flying out of here . 
would it help if i got out and pushed ? 
funny ,  i have the feeling i &apos;ve been in this area before .   let me check my logs . 
has threepio turned up yet ? 
 .  .  .  i love you .   i couldn &apos;t tell you before ,  but it &apos;s true . 
there isn &apos;t enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser .  my sentry markers are placed .  i &apos;m heading back to the base . 
why you slimy ,  double - crossing no - good swindler  .  .  .  am i glad to see you . 
that was never mentioned .   neither was this bounty hunter taking han .  i hope you haven &apos;t forgotten our bargain . 
it &apos;s a lovely outpost . 
i knew that set - up was too good to last  .  .  .  .  i &apos;m going to miss it . 
you don &apos;t have to do this to impress me . 
leia ! 
lando ,  is he alright ?   .  .  .  lando ?  are you there ?   how &apos;s luke ? 
ready are you ?   what know you of ready ?   i have trained jedi for 800 years .   my own counsel i &apos;ll keep on who is to be trained . 
it would be in seven pieces ,  were you a jedi . 
okay .   i &apos;ll give it a try . 
concentration .   heh ?   concentration . 
but tell me why  .  .  . 
will they die ? 
all too easy .   perhaps you are not as strong as the emperor thought . 
there is no escape .   you must join me or die .   don &apos;t make me destroy you here  .  .  .  the emperor is strong with the force .   but if you join me ,  together we could overthrow him .   do not resist .  it is our destiny ! 
somehow during the tour ,  she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device .  we don &apos;t know how . 
l . a .  is in a constant state of warfare .  gangs fighting for the right to rule . 
give it . 
it &apos;s so good to see you again . 
i need a favor . 
so what &apos;s the deal ,  gorgeous ? 
she &apos;s in the green . 
plissken .  .  .  ? 
relax ,  war hero .  we took you for a ride ,  and you came through .  not bad for a dirtbag like you . 
you &apos;re a star in your own right ,  you know that ?  hey ,  i &apos;m map to the stars eddie .  how you doin &apos; ? 
too many people know where you &apos;re going ,  snake .  that &apos;s not good .  delgado and his men were back there waiting for you . 
where is it ? 
me too ? 
what &apos;re you doing in here ? 
good .  i want you out .  this is my sewer . 
what are you gonna do in venice ? 
well ,  i &apos;ll think it over . 
all of us ? 
you are still the best knight in christiandom .  you gained a hundred advantages over me .  it is i who must love you ,  for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson . 
these men repented before god for their evil deeds .  those who would not ,  met their fate at the end of my sword .   accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift . 
your deeds set an example for all other knights .  for your gift ,  ask a gift of me . 
they miss the battlefield .  i think we do too . 
at last .  .  . 
merlin ,  help me .  i need your help .  i don &apos;t know how -  - 
i should have left you to fend for yourself . 
yes . 
i have come to claim what is mine ,  father . 
sir .  .  .  kay needed a sword .  his was stolen .  i saw excalibur ,  and .  .  .  i took it . 
i will ride with sir kay .  lancelot ,  rest here . 
and there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you ? 
i have found you .  the queen .  an apple .  tomorrow .  sir gawain .  .  . 
no ,  no ,  of course not .  you are young .  .  . 
you are truly magnificent ! 
i swear it .  by excalibur and the holy -  - 
merlin !  out of the sick sleep at last . 
well ,  he does know the background .  i doubt there &apos;s any danger in just having him assist .  there should be a psychiatrist present ,  anyway . 
it might be best to have a man with experience .  maybe someone who &apos;s spent time in the foreign missions . 
quite frankly ,  we don &apos;t know much about it except that it &apos;s starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient &apos;s delusion that his body &apos;s been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will . 
i &apos;m sorry . 
it &apos;s a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so - called invading spirit .  it &apos;s pretty much discarded these days ,  except by the catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment .  it has worked ,  in fact ,  although not for the reason they think ,  of course .  it was purely the force of suggestion .  the victim &apos;s belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear . 
what the hell do you mean going out and leaving regan by her self !  what are you kidding her window &apos;s wide open .  .  . 
where do you want this ? 
oh ,  she &apos;d love it . 
i lied .  it &apos;s for me .  the spelling is on the back ,  kinderman .  you know that film you made called angel ?  isaw that six times . 
but it &apos;s clean ? 
no .  no rats . 
there is nothing . 
karl ?  did you put this in regan &apos;s bedroom ? 
how are you today ? 
have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities ? 
hey ,  come on ,  i &apos;m grown - up .  what &apos;d she say ?  i mean specifically ,  doctor . 
the shaking of the bed ,  that &apos;s doubtless due to musuclar spasms . 
look doc ,  i really don &apos;t understand how her whole personality could change . 
do you keep any drugs in your house ? 
oh ,  i &apos;m very sorry father .  hi . 
so ,  how &apos;d a shrink ever get to be a priest ? 
did he tell you about my party ? 
didn &apos;t tell you of what she did ? 
priests keep pretty tight mouthed then ? 
no ,  you don &apos;t understand .  your daughter - 
no ,  is regan aware of it ? 
captain who ? 
oh ,  captain howdy .  .  .  .

all done . 
what goes down there ?  i mean who &apos;s the priest i keep seeing ,  he &apos;s there all the time .  he has black hair and he &apos;s very intense looking ? 
pathological states can induce abnormal strength ,  accelerated motor performance .  for example ,  a ninety - pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck ,  runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground .  you know the story ,  same thing here .  same principle ,  i mean . 
where &apos;d you get it then ? 
oh christ !  i should of been there and i wasn &apos;t there ,  i should &apos;ve been there . 
you just missed them . 
do you like films ? 
i get passes .  in fact i got a pass for the crest tomorrow night .  would you like to go ? 
i &apos;m affraid you might hurt yourself regan . 
if you &apos;re the devil ,  why not make the straps disappear ? 
you &apos;d like that ? 
you and regan ? 
ydob eht ni mraw si ti !  uoy ees i !  tseirp a si eh !  emit su evig !  nirrem !  nirrem !

a gust of wind killed him . 
i &apos;m not unhappy . 
what &apos;s there to talk about ?   she can sing .  that puts her at the head of the class .  that makes her the only one in the class . 
how many other silent partners are there ,  frank ?  donna ?   little cindy ?  hell ,  let &apos;s give eddie a vote . 
no . 
oh ,  brother . 
just a lucky guess . 
she was staying at the grand downtown  .  .  . 
frank asked if she &apos;d sit in for a song ,  she said yes ,  and we did a few bars . 
why would i mind ? 
what &apos;s the matter with you ?   so the piano &apos;s a little out of tune .   so what ? 
thank you ,  thank you .   you know ,  susie and jack and i only just arrived here yesterday ,  but already the people here at the king corporation &apos;s moorish manor have made us feel ,  well ,  a part of the family .  and it &apos;s their hope that ,  before you leave ,  everyone of you will feel a part of that family also .   so ,  if during - the next few days ,  we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever  .  .  .  don &apos;t be a stranger .  stop .   say hello .   introduce yourself .   because here ,  there are no strangers ,  only friends .  and family .   right ,  jack ?

let me get the light . 
sneak out in the morning .   before the guy could wake up and ruin it .   never figured i &apos;d be on the other end of it ,  though .

i mean .  .  . 
i don &apos;t think she &apos;s real big on hate . 
how &apos;d you know it was me ? 
we &apos;re going to have to work on your touch . 
i can &apos;t take this . 
they crashed it into a wall .   a flight simulator< / i> . 
we had a tough year . 
it &apos;s about to be a broken face . 
about me ?   how sweet . 
just give reed a little more time .  you know how he works  -  -  analyzing every little step before he takes one  -  - 
ben grimm is a genuine american hero who &apos;s been through a terrible orde -  - 
the synthetics act as a second skin ,  adapting to your individual needs to  -  - 
stop it . 
sweet . 
you two need a time - out . 
johnny ?   did you see ben ? 
leonard ,  how &apos;s the feed ?

but i &apos;m not done with the machine  -  - 
well ,  uh ,  based on our history .  .  . you can handle the biogenetics ,  and i &apos;ll focus on the molecular physics .   or ,  uhm ,  maybe i should take the biotech ,  you work the microscopes ,  since you have some background in electropho -  - 
feeling better ? 
that &apos;s good .   that &apos;s uh .  .  . good . 
you should be able to bend light around other objects ,  even people ,  if you could control your emotional state better  -  - 
i &apos;m sorry ,  i &apos;m sorry ,  i didn &apos;t mean to do that .  .  .  you must think that was some kind of latent hostility or  -  - 
remember our first date here .  .  .  ?   god ,  i was so nervous . 
you always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you .  .  . speak his mind .   one who wasn &apos;t afraid to tell you what he wanted . 
i found a broken gasket ,  from space  -  - 
uh ,  victor ,  i hope i haven &apos;t done something to make you think .  .  . 
if you &apos;re trying to cheer me up you &apos;re doing a helluva job  -  - 
they &apos;ve crossed over into the jugular vein ! 
but we have no choice !  we &apos;ve got ,  to take them out ! 
what are the problems in stopping the heart ? 
i told you to cut down on the sugar .

wish i knew why . 
listen .  .  . the heart . 
what is it ?   anything wrong ? 
a long time ,  with one man . 
shouldn &apos;t you answer that ? 
you &apos;re not the first ,  but he &apos;s much too innocent ,  much too involved with his work ,  to realize what &apos;s going on around him . 
nothing miraculous about it .  just an interchange of gases .  the end product of five hundred million years of evolution . 
 -  - and certain chemicals involving proteins  -  - 
dr .  duval ,  you are not going through with this !  i absolutely forbid it !  i &apos;m responsible for the lives of everyone here !  i will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship ! 
how does it look ,  doctor ? 
you said there was a quick way out ! 
a what ? 
tell them to take us out . 
cough ?  if he can kick up a storm by just <breathing>  -  - 
you have no right to blame duval  -  - 
looks like quite a way to go .  .  . 
out of your element ,  aren &apos;t you ,  captain ? 
what happened ? 
come on  -  -  it &apos;s no use ! 
we feel great ,  don &apos;t we ?  just <great> ?  ! 
thirty - two minutes left .  .  .   but chances are we won &apos;t have to wait that long for try - number three . 
even so ,  because of our size  -  -  i mean lack of it  -  -  we &apos;ll still be cruising mighty fast .  we &apos;ll be smashed to bits if there &apos;s any turbulence  -  - 
i &apos;ll never find my way through that . 
it &apos;s a dangerous procedure .  if i miss the timing ,  we could explode the tanks .  .  .  but i &apos;m willing to try it . 
who the fuck are you ?  who the fuck are you ? 
just in town on business .  just in and out .  ha ha !  a little of the old in - and - out !

you &apos;re kidding . 
um .  .  .  marla ,  should we maybe exchange numbers ? 
i &apos;m just on my way out .  .  . 
like sex crime victims ,  underwear inside - out ,  bound with electrical tape . 
it &apos;s time for you to leave . 
you feel nothing ? 
you .  .  .  don &apos;t have to .  .  .  leave . 
i don &apos;t understand .   why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person .  .  .  to hang onto ? 
what is this ?   who did this ? 
the paper street soap company . 
he &apos;s not here . 
marla .  .  .  i need to talk to you .   it &apos;s going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out . 
two sides ?   you &apos;re dr .  jeckle and mr .  jackass . 
what happened .  .  .   ? 
tyler ? 
how have you been ? 
you were standing right where you are now ,  asking how good our security is .  it &apos;s tight as a drum . 
i had everything in that bag .   my c . k .  shirts .  .  .  my d . k . n . y .  shoes .  .  . 
this is how i met  -  - 
i guess so . 
i don &apos;t follow .  .  . 
would that be a problem ? 
thank you . 
why would anyone want this shitty job ? 
i don &apos;t know about this . 
the fight . 
what ? 
alive or dead ? 
fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails . 
she is a wild ,  twisted bitch .   stay away from that one . 
what ? 
what is this place ? 
as the fat renders ,  the tallow floats to the surface .   remember the crap they taught you in boy scouts . 
stop it .   this is your pain  -  -  your burning hand .   it &apos;s right here .   look at it . 
local 8 just started in penns grove .  and ,  bob said he was at fight club in newcastle last week . 
where did you go ,  psycho - boy ? 
what do you want ?   a statement of purpose .  .  .   ? 
what the hell  .  .  .   ?  ! 
and ,  we &apos;re definitely filling a void in the rural south . 
the first rule of fight club is  -  -  you don &apos;t talk about fight club . 
no !   this isn &apos;t true .   we .  .  .  we were around other people ,  together ,  both of us .  .  . 
 .  .  . stop me ? 
 .  .  . to let this happen ! 
what the fuck  -  -   ? 
damn it !   god - damn it .  .  . 
no ,  no ,  i don &apos;t .   i thank you ,  i really do .   thank you ,  but i don &apos;t need you anymore . 
look at me .  .  . 
excuse me ? 
his name is robert paulson ! 
is this a picture of mom and dad ? 
animals . 
the survivors of flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash .  that was death &apos;s original design . 
i can practically taste the water in my throat .   and something else .   the smell of flowers .  .  . 
are you crazy ?   what makes you think you &apos;d survive ? 
six duds in a row . 
what did you see ?   what am i looking for ? 
another premonition ? 
um ,  clear ?   i &apos;m sorry .  .  . about before .  i .  .  . 
calm down ,  kimmy .   it &apos;s not drugs ,  just weed . 
you &apos;ve made your point . 
please .   it &apos;s not going to wait . 
may we come in ? 
first i &apos;m stuck with jury duty ,  now this nonsense . 
do you remember what triggered it all ? 
it throws the entire death list out of whack .   and a new list has to be rewritten from scratch .   we all start over with a clean slate . 
you can &apos;t cheat destiny .   i know what i have to do to save us .   i have to die . 
welcome back .   we did it .   for real . 
what &apos;s the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to daytona ? 
what is it ?   what are you ? 
more than that .   all the songs on the radio were about car crashes .  some kid &apos;s banging toy cars together .   she was dialing her cell phone with her headset on .   his car was leaking oil all over the road . 
i know this is the first time we &apos;ve been apart since .   but everything &apos;s gonna be okay . 
you went there ?  i &apos;ve wanted to go there ,  but i thought it was off limits . 
can &apos;t you open the door ?  ! 
carter ,  get out ! 
police are coming . 
hope you don &apos;t think ,  browning ,  that because my name ain &apos;t on this wall .  .  .  that i owe you anything . 
me ,  too .   but my dad doesn &apos;t understand .  when he &apos;s better; you and me ,  road trip to the city .  catch the yanks . 
and don &apos;t pass on the right . 
hey ,  man ,  why &apos;d you say that ?  ! 
it broke ! 
you mean the snake ? 
what &apos;s that ? 
hell .   this is just like fucking star wars ,  man ! 
 .  .  .  and there &apos;s this guy with a black helmet and cape ,  right ,  and he &apos;s got this sword .  .  .  except it &apos;s not a sword ,  it &apos;s light .  .  . 
this clown almost blew mission security on the street .   i &apos;m not jumping with him . 
 .  .  .  to target at ban kia na .   we probe the site .  .  . 
 .  .  .  then proceed downriver to extraction at point echo delta .  doyle takes us out by helicopter ,  we all live happily ever after and that &apos;s the last time ,  rambo !   i swear to christ . 
gettin &apos; old ,  huh ? 
batteries not included . 
this place is a trip . 
you fucking crazy ?   i need it to burn these things off . 
brewer .   does a jet make noise ? 
what &apos;s that ? 
snoring .   five ,  six guys .  mumbling .  .  .  vietnamese .   somebody talking in his sleep .   a toilet flushing . 
roundeye . 
how do we get upriver ? 
invulnerable . 
john .   my name is john . 
that &apos;s an order . 
he &apos;s giving them a run for their money .   says here they &apos;ve got two hueys from danang .   i didn &apos;t know those dinks had hueys . 
um .  .  .  actually ,  no .   it looks like he shot down one of their gunships .  .  . 
take your time . 
look ,  it was a screw - up ,  alright ?  they weren &apos;t supposed to find anything .   we thought that camp was empty . 
rambo and brewer were selected as write - offs . 
man ,  you are one scary - looking motherfucker ! 
seems like i &apos;m always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other ,  doesn &apos;t it ? 
that depends on you .   christ ,  look at you .   i give you this easy duty until i can get you an assignment .  .  .  all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas .  .  .  and you have to make it rambo &apos;s last stand . 
this your stuff ? 
this will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if .  .  .  you like at a membership discount . 
you know ,  i think i .  .  .  ordered some just the other day . 
well ,  don &apos;t say it like that .  it &apos;s not so .  .  . ya know ,  crazy an idea .  you are a healthy woman .  .  .  you hold a steady job .  ya not crossed eyed or anything .  .  . 
fine . 
i don &apos;t feel like i make any impression on people .  .  .  at office parties i spend my time re - arranging the hors d &apos;oeuvres as people eat them ,  so the platters will always look full .  i don &apos;t start conversations because i have no idea how to end them .  .  . i think i &apos;m just meant to live in the background of things . 
you know ,  let me tell you something !  i &apos;m not that kind of person .  i don &apos;t do people favors .  if i talk to you it &apos;s because i want to .  so we &apos;re not all  .  .  . uh .  .  . jerri hall .  .  . big deal .  .  .  what a boring world if we were .  you do the best you can with what you got .  you &apos;re not so so invisible ,  ya know .  .  .  you want make an impression ?  try this; you can be a real bitch .

you can &apos;t do this !  this is new york !  nobody lies in naked in a field in new york .  . it &apos;s .  .  . it &apos;s too midwestern . 
maybe ,  when we get the grail .  .  . 
will you stand still so i can do this ! 
unhand that degenerate  -  you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey ! 
owww .  .  .  . what are you nuts ?  !

okay .  hope no one hits on you . 
i &apos;m going on over there .  .  . 
 &quot; every trail that you blaze / makes me .  .  .  &quot;

this certainly is an improvement on the motel an &apos; the coffee shop .   how could you have left such a beautiful place ,  bobby ? 
just finish eating . 
i &apos;m gonna go in that cafe an &apos; get some coffee .  you want anything ? 
i saw a picture of it .  alaska is very clean .  it appeared to look very white to me .  .  .  don &apos;t you think ? 
hey ,  mack ! 
wait ,  i &apos;ve made up my mind .  i want a plain omelette ,  forget the tomatoes ,  don &apos;t put potatoes on the plate ,  and give me a side of wheat toast and a cup of coffee . 
i just can &apos;t look at you . 
it &apos;s not funny .  he permanently sprained his neck ,  and since then it &apos;s been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin . 
robert ,  i have to tell you something .  .  .

well ,  i really appreciate it ,  carl . 
what questions ? 
do you want some gingerbread ? 
hello .  .  . 
swimming ? 
i love to swim ,  and i don &apos;t mind the cold at all .  it &apos;s invigorating . 
why ? 
that &apos;s right .  have you anything to suggest ? 
carl has hydrotherapy on tuesdays . 
you had no inner feeling ? 
wait .  .  . 
no ,  it isn &apos;t what i think . 
up to now ,  what i &apos;ve been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow .  .  . 
it &apos;s convenient to fake looking for something right now ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
robert ? 
no ,  i want to talk to you now .  i have to explain something about .  .  . 
that &apos;ll make you happy . 
four or five years . 
that &apos;s three games to none ,  carl . 
suit yourself .  but i &apos;ll tell you ,  where we &apos;re headed is gonna get colder &apos;n hell . 
oh no ,  it &apos;s been much more than that . 
you know ,  just after i came back off tour with the betenthaller quartet ,  dad ,  myself and herbert had a summit conference about you .  .  . 
what &apos;s wrong ,  carl ,  you hardly ate anything .  .  .

well ,  you know i &apos;m standin &apos; here and you say i look good ? 
no you didn &apos;t ,  you ain &apos;t provin &apos;it .

fletch f .  fletch

i &apos;ve got it all under control ,  jerry .  you can go now .

good evening . 
i was already prepared to commit one murder .  what makes you think i won &apos;t commit two ? 
velma .  you and velma are the parents of alan stanwyk ,  beverly hills ,  california ,  executive vice president of boyd aviation ? 
ten days ago ? 
why are they after you ? 
because we can &apos;t . 
i want you to come to my house .  then we &apos;ll talk . 
it is nothing of a sexual nature i assure you .   one thousand ,  just to listen .  i don &apos;t see how you could turn that down mr .  .  . 
so it looks like a burglary attempt .  you catch me .  i get the gun ,  and shoot you . 
what &apos;s the difference ?  the noise &apos;ll kill you first . 
that &apos;s a strange combination . 
who is it ? 
 &apos;i &apos;ve acted out my life on stages ,  with ten thousand people watching .  .  .  &apos;
a four hundred dollar lunch tab ! 
he told me he was dying of cancer .  not true .  that ranch you thought you were paying for in utah ?  not true . 
he &apos;s a bad guy ,  mrs .  stanwyk .  gail .  i think he &apos;s involved in something very big and very bad . 
have you ever heard the name jim swarthout ? 
no .  .  .  i &apos;ve got to go to mr .  underhill .  .  . 
what are you talking about ? 
wait a second .  what am i supposed to do for twenty - four hours ? 
i &apos;ve never lied to him before .   it &apos;s the first time he &apos;s ever lied to me .  he was just as convincing as when he says  &apos;i love you .  &apos;
you can &apos;t do that . 
i would ,  actually . 
i was supposed to meet mrs .  cavanaugh . 
i spoke to her last week .  she didn &apos;t say anything . 
tell the cops . 
fletch . 
 &apos;uh ,  almost &apos; is not an answer .   &apos;yes frank ,  it &apos;s all done &apos; :  that &apos;s an answer . 
two .  .  . 
i will ,  frank ,  i will .  something came up ,  okay ? 
who ? 
you &apos;re onto something .  that &apos;s good .  what ? 
yeah .  it &apos;s wedged in between wyoming and nevada .  i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve seen pictures . 
i &apos;m out ,  frank .  you lost faith in me . 
fletch ,  you want an apology ? 
you don &apos;t know the underhills ? 
but i ain &apos;t got you .  .  . 
no ,  i ain &apos;t got you .  .  . 
damnit .  .  .  you were right last night .  jonathan and i were into more than sex .   along with bobby vomit ,  right after old jack grendel died ,  we took part in a scheme to rip off grendel records .  .  .  i didn &apos;t want you involved .  .  . 
that was close .  .  . 
so many assholes ,  so few bullets . 
you gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and i don &apos;t mean your legs .   why didn &apos;t you jump on her ?   what &apos;s happening to you ? 
julian &apos;s happy as long as he doesn &apos;t see glass shatter . 
that &apos;s for me .  .  .  radio contests ,  really ford ,  how tacky .  .  . 
quiet .   tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about art mooney .  .  . 
why did you interrupt ?   maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  that dress .   what do you say we .  .  . 
you okay ? 
aha ,  just what i suspected ! 
hmmm ,  the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits .   this one is putting out low bits .   the data is in some fucked binary system .   the two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc .   comprendo ? 
without grendel knowing about it .  b - i - n - g - o and bingo was his name - o .  counterfeit c . d . s .   tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy ,  the sound quality &apos;s better ,  and so &apos;s the money . 
you hung out with bobby vomit .  who would want him dead ? 
i know the feeling .   this must be hell .   can you believe ,  a flucking sorority .  .  .  i &apos;m gonna vomit day - glo . 
nice left you got there ,  jerk . 
this way .  .  . 
suck a dick ,  i left my purse .  .  .

i &apos;m sorry .  .  . 
i need someone to help me with my case load ,  you interested ?   this whole father / son thing ,  if you &apos;re not into it ,  i mean ,  it &apos;s okay .  you know what i &apos;m saying ? 
nice tie ,  lt .  anus ,  sir . 
 &apos;booty time .  &apos;
feel my thumb ?   i keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain .   i leave .   twenty -  one minutes later ,  you &apos;re dead .  the slowest ,  most painful minutes a person can experience . 
good to meet you ,  mr .  fairlane .  your mouth makes quite a reflection .   i &apos;m julian grendel . 
so what did you think of the ballet ?  was it like a warm ice capades ? 
shit . 
yeah ,  it &apos;s pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music .   those ingrates really take a bite .   but seriously ,  when pops died ,  you got vomit ,  crunch ,  and sutton to help finance a c . d .  cleans operation .  you got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you ,  but .  .  . 
man ,  julian ,  that accident took away more than your hearing .

i know .   how long will you be gone ? 
will you take me ? 
i can help you . 
i have a friend who has a fine rug .  maybe your wife would like it . 
your friend lives in a fine building . 
who is the greatest man you can think of ? 
do you think he &apos;d be satisfied with the two hundred dollars ?   i think he would . 
we &apos;re going to europe next week .   i want to get passage booked on the queen . 
listen ,  michael &apos;s got a lot of nice people here .   friends of kay &apos;s .  he &apos;ll never forgive me if you ruin his party . 
i don &apos;t want to stay here .  .  . 
would you like some ? 
you would risk your life for strangers ? 
you tell your friends i expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner .   don &apos;t be afraid to tell them .   clemenza and i know each other well ,  he understands these things .   let yourself be guided by him .   he has more experience in these matters . 
ready ,  frankie . 
gee ,  frankie ,  it &apos;s good to see you .  reminds me of old times . 
oh ,   &apos;scuse me . 
jeeze ,  it &apos;s great you came along ,  mike .  .  .  you know ,  we &apos;ve never spent a night out on the town together .  i always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time . 
mikey ,  why would they ever hit poor old frankie five - angels ?   i loved that ole sonuvabitch .   i remember when he was just a  &apos;button ,  &apos; when we were kids .   we used to put bedsheets on our heads ,  you know ,  like we were ghosts .   an &apos; ole frankie come peek into our room ,  we &apos;d jump up ,  and he &apos;d always pretend like he was really scared .  you remember ? 
beautiful . 
just now when johnny ola showed up ,  he asked me to leave them alone .  ola is hyman roth &apos;s sicilian contact .   i was on the inside of ten ,  twenty meetings with him .   but today mike asked me to leave ,  like an outsider . 
rocco ! 
she took a flight to san francisco .  we figure she &apos;s going to connect to new hampshire; her parents &apos; place . 
if you need anything ,  just .  .  . 
there &apos;s a lot i can &apos;t tell you ,  tom .  i know that &apos;s upset you in the past; and you &apos;ve felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence .   but it is because i do trust you that i &apos;ve kept so much secret from you .   it &apos;s precisely that at this moment ,  you are the only one that i can completely trust .   in time ,  you &apos;ll understand everything . 
mikey ,  i hoped .  .  . 
what was it ,  so i &apos;ll know . 
i asked about fredo ? 
and kay .  .  . she &apos;s all right ? 
i &apos;m surprised at you ,  tom .   if there &apos;s anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything ,  it &apos;s that you can kill .  .  .   anybody .   but perhaps your relucatance is because you &apos;ve come to tell me that you &apos;re moving your family to vegas ,  that you &apos;ve been offered the vice - presidency of the houstan hotels there .   or weren &apos;t you going to tell me at all ? 
yeah .   he wouldn &apos;t even go out to dinner .   just wanted to go home . 
no strings . 
there &apos;s thirty grand worth of paid off markers  -  -  i never owed that much . 
and what &apos;s the price of their not finding out . 
does it feel like a boy ? 
i &apos;m sorry about some of the people i had to see today .   it was bad timing .  .  .  but it couldn &apos;t be helped . 
i won &apos;t let you leave !   christ ,  do you think i &apos;m going to let you leave . 
no ,  i don &apos;t want to hear anything .  there are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years .   you are my wife ,  and they are my children .  .  .  and i love you and i will not let you leave ,  because you are mine ! 
we &apos;ll go back tonight .   bring the children . 
are you klingman ? 
i still don &apos;t speak spanish ,  michael . 
terrible .   i &apos;d give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting . 
i know it wasn &apos;t me .  .  . so that leaves you . 
hiya ,  mr .  corleone ,  i &apos;m sam roth .  welcome to the capri; my brother &apos;s upstairs .   you wanta take a rest before you see him ,  or can i get you something ,  anything at all ? 
it occurred to me :  the police are paid to fight ,  and the rebels are not . 
i &apos;m sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague .   now ,  mr .  corleone ,  you have been advised as to your legal rights .   we have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful mafia family in this country .   are you ? 
is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the five families in new york ,  to assume and consolidate your nefarious power ? 
i know . 
sure ,  pete clemenza died of a heart attack ,  but the rosato brothers gave it to him . 
you give your loyalty to a jew over your own blood . 
don corleone ,  i wish you let me know you was coming .   we could have prepared something for you . 
senator geary ,  i speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state .   i have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here .   the license fee from the gambling commission costs one thousand dollars; why would i ever consider paying more ? 
we &apos;ll try . 
excuse me ,  i hope i am not a disturbance ,  don corleone . 
your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me ,  and i want to show that i ,  too ,  have some christian charity .   her rent will remain what it was . 
what makes you say that ? 
yeah ,  well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself . 
you know what ?   i think you guys are all jealous . 
i &apos;ve gotten to know someone who &apos;s famous . 
i wasn &apos;t going to try anything . 
he &apos;s an artist .   anyway ,  he &apos;s too old to think about sex . 
don &apos;t worry ,  you already paid me .  i &apos;m here because  -  - 
what &apos;re you talking about ? 
gimme a break .   i &apos;m going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures .   is that going to hurt him ? 
you &apos;re sure of that ? 
sins of the flesh ?   everybody has those . 
thanks .   why do you do it ? 
take care of mr .  whale like he was your flesh and blood . 
you must leave .   you were not here this morning . 
and your name is  -  -  ? 
i couldn &apos;t help but notice your tattoo .   that phrase ?   death before dishonor .   what does it mean ? 
getting to be a warm day .   a scorcher ,  as you yanks call it . 
these are your paintings ? 
i returned recently from a stay in hospital . 
but expressively broken .   how did it happen ? 
what are you suggesting ?   you &apos;ll charge extra if i include a hand or a bit of shoulder . 
that shirt ,  mr .  boone . 
is this david &apos;s doing ? 
saw your movie the other night .  watched it with some friends . 
i liked it .   we all did . 
quite true .   hand - to - hand combat is the true test .   did you ever slay anyone hand - to - hand ? 
just a trim .   and mine while you &apos;re at it .   fingers are a bit stiff today . 
so we understand each other ? 
tell me more about yourself ,  mr .  boone .   you have a steady companion ? 
ah .   a philosopher . 
is that why you and your friend split up ?   because you wanted to be free ? 
i think we all want to feel we &apos;ve left our mark on the world .   yes .  i wish i had done more work . 
isn &apos;t it enough you told me you &apos;re a fairy ?   do you have to rub my nose in it ? 
and the fear you showed at our last session ?   how did you overcome that ? 
same difference ,  mr .  boone .  disgust ,  fear of the unknown  -  -  all part of the great gulf that stands between us .   am i right in assuming that you &apos;ve had little experience with men of my persuasion ? 
it was foolishness to attempt this portrait .   you cannot force what will not flow . 
very good ,  clayton .   may i call you clayton ?   or do you prefer boone ? 
 -  -  that i was a marine .   which is true .   you filled in the rest . 
i figured he &apos;d think ,  you know  -  -  it was the next best thing .   hey ,  i loved it too .   a chance to be a part of something important .  something bigger than yourself . 
you know what he did when i called him ?   he laughed .   he laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel .   said it was a good lesson for me .   not to try to fill his shoes . 
them &apos;s the breaks ,  right ?   no war stories for this pup . 
why ? 
break my neck .   or strangle me .   it would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me .   please ,  clayton .  we &apos;ve come this far . 
i &apos;m up .   thanks . 
then take the pills . 
by the way ,  i like the renoir . 
what are you doing here ? 
should you be drinking in your condition ? 
uh - oh .   the way you look at me ,  james .   what have you done this time ? 
and you said there &apos;d be some of me left .   nobody &apos;s going to know me in this getup . 
i saw una o &apos;conner a few weeks ago .  she said you &apos;d been under the weather . 
we &apos;re all getting a bit long in the tooth . 
we &apos;ll be in touch ,  jimmy . 
hanna ?   who &apos;s the new yardman ? 
how are you feeling ,  mr .  jimmy ?  how is your mind today ? 
i am not forgetting your last brief chat . 
he looks plenty big .   you won &apos;t need my help if anything goes flooey . 
that is my daughter .   she say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon .   i am sorry ,  mr .  jimmy .   i will make it short . 
am i correct in assuming ,  mr .  kay ,  that it &apos;s not me you &apos;re interested in ,  only my horror pictures ? 
i have a proposal ,  mr .  kay .   this mode of questioning is getting old ,  don &apos;t you think ? 
george cukor ?   who made  &quot; a star is born &quot;  ?   i never guessed .

i &apos;d come to the realization that everything i &apos;d based my life on was false .  and that my life had no meaning . 
that &apos;s a tragedy .  can i finish my story please ?  i began my search for meaning .  i was a catholic ,  jew ,  scientologist ,  sufi ,  buddhist .  i went to a psychologist ,  psychiatrist ,  herbalist ,  nutritionist ,  a shaman ,  and a psychic .  and they all pretty much say the same stuff . 
basically the same thing .  in a very evolved ,  esoteric way . 
that &apos;s it ?

what if i come back ? 
we &apos;ve spent a lot of time discussing those years .  remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared ,  to the thought of the thing .  thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite . 
yes . 
go to your reunion ,  martin .  see those people and discover what they mean to you .  try not to kill anybody for a few days ,  see how you feel . 
what else ?  say more . 
that &apos;s it then .  that &apos;s it .  i &apos;ve always been alone .  that &apos;s why i &apos;m a good driver .  i can handle it .  see ,  i can think on my feet .  i survive ,  i &apos;m a thinker .  and i can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don &apos;t bother me .  some people can &apos;t do it !  some people are ranting and raving ,   &quot; tell them fuckin &apos; people to get out here and get in this car ,  i can &apos;t -  -  i want a go !  &quot;  where you gonna go ?  you &apos;re gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o &apos;clock at night .  you ain &apos;t going nowhere .  you leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening .  what &apos;s the big deal ,  right ? 
i been looking at you ,  and i &apos;ve decided that i want to share something with you . 
i told them to kill you and they didn &apos;t .

i have to get my head back into my work . 
so when are you authorized to use deadly force ?

i &apos;m a professional killer . 
look ,  i &apos;ll talk to grace and call you later -  - 
you know ,  we &apos;re branding here tomorrow .  if you two want to come by to watch or give a hand ,  you &apos;re welcome . 
that &apos;s your cue to say you &apos;re not laughing at me . 
i &apos;ve decided it &apos;s impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat . 
the answer &apos;s no . 
poor thing . 
now ,  listen .  i want you to stand on him . 
summers are short here ,  annie .  there isn &apos;t much of a fall .  before you know it ,  the roads are closed .  .  .  the nights get long .

you &apos;ve already made arrangements !  ? 
what .  .  .  bo -  .  .  .  what about the magazine ?

so ,  how are you doing in marlboro country ?  is the magazine complaining at all ? 
i miss you ,  annie .

are you going to stay in the city or go up to connecticut ? 
i &apos;ll tell you something ,  annie  -  -  i stood there looking at what was happening to that horse .  .  .  and ,  i swear ,  it felt like the same thing was happening to me . 
you know ,  that &apos;s interesting .  i always wondered when i went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a black angus steak .  i couldn &apos;t taste any difference although i could swear one was more tender .  i didn &apos;t know there was that big a difference between cows .  .  .   i &apos;ve never been on a cow farm before .  i must say ,  the bulls seem to have the best time of it .  just laying around the fields all day until they &apos;re asked to .  .  .   do their .  .  .  work .

i always ,  i - i always imagine that i have things . 
now ,  don &apos;t get alarmed .   these are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than i can run here .   i mean ,  it &apos;s ,  it &apos;s nothing . 
dusty &apos;s just bought a huge house in southampton and he &apos;s in the process of decorating it . 
it &apos;s not that big a deal .   we just didn &apos;t hit it off . 
hi ,  dusty . 
i got a lot more to learn ,  though .  i really wasn &apos;t into art when i was a kid . 
yeah .   some of them .  .  . yeah ,  some of them are very big . 
oh ,  well ,  you know frederick .   one of his moods .   although it wasn &apos;t a bad week .   he  uh ,  sold a picture . 
where are you headed ? 
well ,  listen ,  you didn &apos;t know me before frederick .   i &apos;d .  .  . i &apos;d start with a beer at about ten in the morning ,  and .  .  . go on . 
yes ?  lee  a couple of blocks from here .   if you don &apos;t know about it ,  you should .  you &apos;d really love it .

oh ,  book ?   oh ,  no ,  i .  .  .   i &apos;m killing time .   i .  .  . i - i just ,  uh ,  w - want to browse ,  uh .  .  . 
unless ,  of course ,  if - if you had some time ,  i mean ,  we could get some coffee . 
no ,  no .   i - i - i understand completely .  no problem .   y - you &apos;re busy .   i - i - i .  .  . 
fine .   oh ,  we went to the caravaggio exhibition at the met .   it &apos;s such a treat to go through a museum with frederick .   i mean .  .  . you learn so much .   do you like caravaggio ? 
i - i read a poem of you and thought of his last week .   a poem of  his and thought of you last -  -   you &apos;ll be fine ,  though .   lee walks over to elliot in the center aisle .   she looks at the book . 
he &apos;s got like six gold records . 
oh ,  and holly met a wonderful man who loves opera .   an architect . 
uh .  .  . did you ever get around to e . e .  cummings ? 
they have a very large gay clientele ,  you know ,  where i get my teeth cleaned ,  and .  .  . all the hygienists now wear gloves because they &apos;re afraid of aids . 
did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve ? 
and be ready to make light of the offer if she &apos;s unresponsive .   this has to be done very skillfully ,  very diplomatically . 
elliot ! 
i was looking for you . 
wh -  -  ,  uh ,  i know ,  i know but ,  i am in love with you . 
i know !   i - i - i - i ,  i realize . 
oh ,  no ,  no .   well ,  yes !   i love you . 
tch ,  w - well ,  for a million reasons . 
your guilt is because you feel the same . 
i thought you weren &apos;t coming . 
that was just perfect .   you &apos;ve ruined me for anyone else . 
you bet . 
where &apos;re you going ? 
no ! 
well ,  what is it then ?   what ?   eh ,  what &apos;s come between us ?   how have i alienated you ?

oh ,  christ !   what &apos;s wrong with you ?  ! 
oh ,  god ,  i don &apos;t even know what i want . 
in - in - in - instead of the child molestation sketch ,  why don &apos;t we repeat the cardinal spellman ronald reagan homosexual dance number ? 
two months ago ,  you thought you had a malignant melanoma . 
it was on your shirt ! 
can you understand how meaningless everything is ?   everything !   i &apos;m talking about nnnn -  - our lives ,  the show .  .  . the whole world ,  it &apos;s meaningless . 
do you miss frederick ? 
you &apos;ve always had good taste in husbands ,  so .  .  . 
come on !   hurry up !   let &apos;s go ! 
what are you talking about ? 
um ,  i - i didn &apos;t really want to ,  you know ,  go to a sperm bank or something ,  have some anonymous donor .   i - i just ,  you know ,  i - i - i wouldn &apos;t want that . 
i know .   h - how much do you need ? 
well ,  in order to get started ,  there &apos;s just a few things i have to buy .  .  .   and some old debts i have outstanding .

hey ,  what &apos;s the matter ? 
i love songs about extraterrestrial life ,  don &apos;t you ? 
thanks for a swell time . 
i was so bored ! 
this crowd wouldn &apos;t know the difference !   they &apos;re embalmed ! 
you know ,  it &apos;s probably my fault .  i &apos;ve been a little depressed lately . 
god ! 
yes ,  you do recall ,  right ? 
 .  .  . and i thought i &apos;d come in and .  .  . and we could replay ,  uh ,  the whole ,  uh .  .  .

you must be joking .   i &apos;ve been doing all my own reading since i was forty .  .  . you know . 
no ,  you can tell me straight .   it &apos;s okay .   just ,  you know ,  tell me what you think . 
it &apos;s all right . 
tch . 
yeah ,  she knows it ,  too ,   &apos;cause she &apos;s flirting with all the men here . 
dad .  .  . 
 .  .  . you haven &apos;t found< / u> him yet . 
would you mind saying that into your bag .  .  .  ? 
what have they got you doing ? 
i would have figured you an r . n .  by now ,  or ,  maybe med school . 
i &apos;m looking for .  .  . 
did you ever think ,  did you think ,  after he escaped ,  he would come after you ? 
no ,  you &apos;re wrong about verger . 
well ,  if he hasn &apos;t ,  i &apos;m vastly mistaken . 
hard up as you are ,  at your age ?   whadda you< / u> care ?   surrender . 
how you doin ? 
what ,  what ,  i can &apos;t hear you .  .  . 
i almost shot the baby< / u> .  .  . 
how was america ? 
 .  .  . nightmare . 
the identity of the person offering the bounty was never established . 
 .  .  . why did he come back ?   why did the boy turn back .  .  .  ? 
do< / u> it .  .  . 
 .  .  . sir .  .  .  ? 
i like popcorn .  .  . 
agent starling ,  would you come with me .  .  .  ? 
what reaction ? 
and how would you know that ? 
no ,  i think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates . 
yes ,  i did . 
why ? 
i think that &apos;s .  .  .  {he starts to rise ,  and the meeting begins to break up) starling ,  i &apos;m sure these gentlemen .  .  . 
i &apos;m an orphan . 
i said how &apos;s your baby .  .  .  ? 
 .  .  . you told me you were studying for your examination by the studiolo< / u> .  .  . 
of course ,  commendatore .  .  . 
it is only temporary ,  until my confirmation by .  .  . 
and ?   then ? 
i &apos;ve left my program< / u> .  .  . 
she &apos;s not the first foster that you &apos;ve had .   is< / u> she ? 
do you like it at your home ,  franklin ? 
 .  .  . they eat the dummy ,  sir ,  they eat the man< / u> .  .  .  i keep them hungry .   when .  .  .  when do we think this man arrives . 
you find something objectionable to working in partnership with .  .  .  . 
and ,  fine ,  alright ,  and fine .  .  .  what are you< / u>doing ,  this whole time ? 
are you done< / u> ? 
what &apos;s that ,  baby ? 
look what they put her on .  .  . 
you should get married . 
yeah ,  that &apos;s too hip for the room . 
 .  .  . why are we here in the first< / u> place .  .  .  ? 
no .   invite us ?   no ,  he simply .  .  . 
i want the money . 
but perhaps ,  there is some ,  some less radical solution . 
then tell me . 
then ,  that being so ,  why is today special ?   why have you come back to see me ?   is it that new file they gave you ? 
 .  .  . you called up memories of your father< / u> to .  .  . 
 .  .  . barter< / u> with her .   to appeal to her ,  and you feel that .  .  . 
it is you< / u> who have betrayed .  .  . 
yes . 
i saw a man today ,  a man so hideously deformed who &apos;ll spend his life in a hospital bbb .  .  . 
yes ,  but no one is in control of their emotions .   that &apos;s all we have time for today .  .  .  
your life has been defined by institutions .   the orphanage where you were raised ,  the fbi academy ,  the bureau .   if the institution is your life ,  accept< / u> it .   ask to be reinstated on the  &quot; drumgo &quot;  task force .   play their game . 
and all he left< / u> us :   the country brought back his hat< / u> ,  and his badge< / u> .  .  .  both with a bullethole in them .   an &apos; that &apos;s what he left us .   that &apos;s what i said . 
ah ,  yes ,  ah yes .   our doctor lechter .  .  .  and have they sent you ,  once again to capture< / u> him ?   how terrible for you .  .  . 
yes ,  then ,  you &apos;re saying that you haven &apos;t< / u> bid upon these drawings . 
i &apos;ll bet you &apos;re glad i waited until the last day to have this conversation . 
summer would have been a lot less without you .  you &apos;re a true friend ,  donald . 
do you realize if the women of america would have just heard what you said .  .  . 
she &apos;s still pissed at me and took it out on you .  we should have taken it slower .  it &apos;s hard to operate in the woods .  much easier in ,  like a club .   tell the girl you &apos;ve got to go do something ,  leave her view ,  take way too long until she is worried that you &apos;re not coming back .  just as she starts feeling awful ,  you come up from behind and touch her neck .  .  . 
i couldn &apos;t tell her .  .  . it &apos;s ,  it &apos;s too major .  .  . jesus ,  i &apos;m starting to believe in god and what &apos;s worse i think i like the guy .  the lightning bolt was just a test ,  right ?   wendy and i -  - we &apos;re meant to be .  i &apos;m right ,  right ?   i have to see her .  .  . 
thanks ,  talia .  .  . why are you so nice to me ?

sorry veronica . 
ronnie ,  i &apos;m still a virgin . 
betty ,  your daydreams are a lot better than my realities ,  believe me .  i &apos;m afraid though it &apos;s time to get your butt kicked . 
all right . 
goddamn .  will somebody please tell me why i smoke these damn things ? 
let me get it clear ,  veronica .  you want yourself a sweet homeboy for this t . v .  show so you can show everybody what a loose ,  martin luther cosby - lovng place westerburg is . 
damn ,  you &apos;re a shrewd one .  shrewd . 
you don &apos;t have anything for< / u> her either .  come on ,  it &apos;ll be very .  the note &apos;ll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks . 
hey ,  this question wouldn &apos;t be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last .  .  .  .  .  . 
if you &apos;re going to openly be a bitch .  .  .  . 
you wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school .  if i wasn &apos;t already the head of it ,  i &apos;d want the same thing . 
that episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy ,  but you &apos;re determined to ruin my day . 
crap .  so who &apos;s this brad guy i &apos;ve been set up with ?  witty and urbane pre - lawyer or albino accountant ? 
you were nothing before you met me !  you were playing barbies with betty finn !  you were a brownie ,  you were a bluebird ,  you were a girl scout cookie !  i got you into a remington party !  what &apos;s my thanks ?  it &apos;s on the hallway carpet .  i get paid in puke ! 
i think you can .  in catcher in the rye holden says his ideal job &apos;d be making sure some kids don &apos;t fall off a cliff .  he doesn &apos;t realize if you pay too much attention to the kids ,  you &apos;ll back off the cliff yourself . 
i said i was sorry . 
ram asked me out ,  but he wants to double with kurt and kurt doesn &apos;t have a date . 
shit . 
probably just row on out to the middle of a lake .  bring along my sax ,  some tequila ,  and some bach . 
i &apos;ve been moved around all my life; dallas ,  baton rouge ,  vegas ,  sherwood ohio ,  there &apos;s always a 7 - 11 .  any town ,  any time ,  i can pop a ham and cheese in the microwave and feast on a big wheel .  keeps me sane . 
the extreme always makes an impression ,  but you &apos;re right ,  it was severe .  did you say a cherry or coke slurpee ? 
everybody &apos;s life &apos;s got static .  is your life perfect ? 
now blah - blah - blah is all i do .  i use my grand i . q .  to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew .  some genius . 
something tells me you picked up the wrong cup . 
so what ?  don &apos;t smile like that ,  jesus ! 
i don &apos;t get the point of me writing a suicide note when we &apos;ll just be shooting them with blanks . 
you can be so immature ! 
i &apos;m going to make this ms .  pauline thing work .  lines of communication between the cliques .  you were a phase .  .  .  . 
you &apos;re still not listening !  i &apos;m not .  . 
this knife is filthy . 
if you &apos;ll excuse me .  .  .  .  .  . 
who does that new kid think he is with that coat ?  bo diddley ? 
you going to eat this ? 
we on tonight man ? 
heather chandler ,  kurt kelly ,  and rupert  &quot; ram &quot;  sweeney all had good looks and popularity ,  but there &apos;s one thing they didn &apos;t have :  values ,  ambition ,  and hope . 
yvonne hasn &apos;t been herself ,  either .  locking herself away in her room  .   .   .  endlessly writing . 
accompanies hilda into the hallway . 
 got an a ,  mum ! 
holds up a loaded fork .  pauline reluctantly takes it . 
you have it . 
hello ! 
mummy ! 
john has fallen in love with me ! 
how do you know ?  did he tell you ? 
i think i &apos;m going crazy . 
but that &apos;s not true !  i &apos;ve got one . 
i thought for hours about whether carmelita should accept bernard &apos;s marriage proposal  .   .   . 
that `poor me &apos; attitude doesn &apos;t suit you trevor .  listen ,  i don &apos;t mean to sound like pollyanna but things could be worse .  there &apos;s one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life .  everything is new and exciting ,  like your seeing it for the first time .  you might see things a litlle differently from now on . 
these hallucinations i &apos;m having .  i think they &apos;re more like memories coming back to me in a strange way . 
if they &apos;re blocked memories .  .  .  i &apos;m starting to realize the reason why i blocked them out .  allison i think i really .  .  .  screwed everything up . 
don &apos;t tell me .  kirsty used to smoke ? 
trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming .  so practically everything say is going to sound strange . 
no . 
i understand .  .  .  i won &apos;t - 
why didn &apos;t you tell me sooner ?  i would have switched doctors ! 
the boss won &apos;t notice me doing a bad job because i &apos;m not .  even if the boss thought i was slacking i &apos;d know right away . 
you were supposed to have a date with gwen last night ?  gwen deardon ?  the supervisor ? 
hey if you &apos;re not doing anything i &apos;d like to buy you a beer after work .  be just like old times . 
i &apos;ve got a better offer .  more time off .  a sort of career shift ,  more in the engineering line of work . 
so you &apos;re just packing it up just like that ? 
bret .  .  .  what the fuck .  .  .  ? 
why don &apos;t you relax for the next couple of hours ?  barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that . 
who &apos;s allison ? 
no .  no you said her body &apos;s been missing . 
as in one minus one equals zero yes .  where are you going with this ? 
the best business decision if you ever made i &apos;ll bet . 
and besides ,  i thought ,  to hell with it .  .  .  it &apos;s okay if you only married me for my money . 
trevor i &apos;ve decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother &apos;s .  this poor kid &apos;s going to be starting preschool as student x if we don &apos;t make up our minds .  so ,  i &apos;ve been thinking ,  what about daisy ? 
and as far as hiding a body goes ?  i find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim &apos;s remains hidden simply to get someone to confess .  it &apos;s absolutely preposterous .  now i &apos;m not saying i don &apos;t believe you ,  i &apos;m .  .  .  . ambiguous .  there &apos;s quite alot of money behind all this . 
hello ?  city ?  cops ?  it &apos;s a fucking conspiracy ! 
hey buddy ! 
okay how many fingers am i holding up ? 
how is our little student doing ?  has he learned his lesson yet ? 
i &apos;m kinda feeling nuts myself ! 
hey you &apos;re the guy from down the hall . 
a lotta people wouldn &apos;t have tried .  it was pretty brave even trying .  .  . 
that &apos;s for ga .  .  .  ms .  gayley . 
what have i done ?   i was dirt poor and useless .  .  .  but i was honest . 
there was this kid there saying ,   &quot; go in there and save my father ,  mister .  &quot;  and i &apos;m thinking about my boy joey and this goddamn fireman my wife &apos;s seeing .  it was like i was supposed to save myself . 
 &quot; anticipation of incarceration &quot;  ? 
yeah ,  i been calling in sick .   they think i got the flu . 
often ,  uh . 
she don &apos;t like me to see him .  says i &apos;m a bad influence . 
mister laplante ,  i really want to help you ,  but crazy stories are only going to make it worse .   the d . a .  is asking your bail be set at twenty - five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail .  .  . 
that fake inspired< / u> you to loan a guy who &apos;s been fired off his job twenty - five hundred< / u> goddamn dollars ?  a guy you say is probably gonna do< / u> time< / u> !   you &apos;re s &apos;posed to be an attorney< / u> for chrissake !   you &apos;re s &apos;posed to have good judgment< / u> ! 
what wouldja say if i toldja i ran into a burning plane an &apos; saved a buncha people ,  chick ,  an &apos; risked my goddamnlife ? 
bill ,  i got some legal problems and i .  .  . 
bill ,  listen .  .  . 
it &apos;s never your fault ,  bernie !  never ever !   you screwed up my life ,  now you &apos;re gonna screw up joey &apos;s life ,  but you &apos;re never gonna accept responsibility for anyth -  - 
you ! 
my fault !   my fault !   this nut case goes out on a ledge and it &apos;s my fault ? 
hey ,  lady ,  i got faults ,  i know i &apos;m not perfect but i don &apos;t get this at all ,  your attitude .   i saved your .  .  . 
underbelly ! 
i snuck in . 
listen ,  mister laplante .  .  .  uh ,  bernie .  .  .  who .  .  .  are .  .  .  you ? 
you never saw that picture ,  huh ? 
i know the truth ,  john .   i &apos;m flying in some guys from your unit in vietnam tomorrow .   interviewing them live on network hookup ! 
i just remembered .   you were talking about bodybuilding and swearing . 
gale !   this is for you .   i want you to know i never meant to hurt you .  this will explain everything . 
 &quot; a little mistake &quot;  ! 
swiped your purse !   while he was saving you ?   you gotta be kidding ! 
he &apos;s gotta be a nut !   he saves all those people and swipes a purse< / u> ? 
that too . 
she wants to quit ? 
gale shoulda aired that bit first ,  she &apos;s the one who found this clown laplante !   she let channel eight get a beat on us . 
it &apos;s not unthinkable . 
my father didn &apos;t have his shoes on when he .  .  .  when he came here . 
if i gave you the impression i hated him i didn &apos;t mean to .   i .  .  .  i hate the way he behaves< / u> .  .  .  he &apos;s selfish and self - centered and cynical .  .  . 
laplante !   that asshole !   i don &apos;t .  .  .  hey ,  is that you ,  from the tee vee ?  in person ? 
you didn &apos;t .  .  .  get it on with him ? 
safety ? 
yeah ,  things are moving along ,  but she &apos;s still involved with this other guy and it &apos;s a little tricky . 
that &apos;s terrific .   don &apos;t be afraid to be demonstrative .   you &apos;re sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke . 
as long as you keep remembering why . 
the whole disapproval thing .   if you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else &apos;s potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life  -  -  then you &apos;re back to a life of fear ,  aren &apos;t you ?    -  -  you &apos;re a prisoner to that again ,  and that isn &apos;t much of a life . 
i can &apos;t help you if you don &apos;t help yourself .   it &apos;s really up to you .  brooding endlessly isn &apos;t going to help matters any . 
oh ,  well ,  do you fix refrigerators ? 
i apologize for that scene with my husband .   you must have overheard . 
you must value your independence . 
it &apos;s nice that you can make that choice . 
i was thinking about our conversation the other day  -  -  what you said about choices . 
hey .   have a nice time  -  -  it &apos;s a good school . 
it &apos;s the middle of the night ,  sweetie . 
your daddy and i are kind of mad at each other right now ,  so we have to spend some time apart . 
did you hear that ? 
how was lunch ? 
neil &apos;s still having a bad time at school .   i feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time . 
no ,  i &apos;m not kidding you ,  philip< / u> . 
barbara zelman< / u> ?   i don &apos;t believe this ! 
who told you that  -  -  someone on the radio ? 
i thought we &apos;d be happy here . 
the cab &apos;s waiting ! 
i don &apos;t know  -  -  put  &apos;em in the drawer with all the chinese take -  away menus . 
the floor has a nice shine to it .   oh god  -  -  we have twenty - two messages on the machine . 
that &apos;s not the case . 
boy ,  you really buckle under a little pressure ,  don &apos;t you ? 
you &apos;re even sadder and more burnt -  out than i thought . 
and what was that neighbor guy doing here ? 
because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings . 
are we gonna buy this house ? 
okay !   we have tv !   we can all get stupid again ! 
hiya ,  sport .   where &apos;d you come from ,  huh ? 
and this  -  -  is the master bedroom . 
my name is jennifer hillman .   i &apos;m an archaeologist .   i read in the paper about the murder yesterday and i thought i should come talk to you . 
he had to come from somewhere . 
detective bedsoe . 
i brought you here to talk about him .  do you know him ? 
no .   i &apos;m telling you right now ,  the next person &apos;s head that comes off is gonna be yours . 
good evening ,  lieutenant . 
we too are brothers ,  macleod .   in fact ,  you have more family than you think . 
must you do that ? 
sing . 
i &apos;m leaving . 
yes . 
your words are kind and they flatter me  -  -  but i think of her as a sister .  besides ,  you hardly know me . 
agreed . 
leaving ?   for how long ? 
do you love me ,  conner ? 
i was wondering if i could talk to you ? 
you &apos;re hurt . 
do you always walk around with a sword ? 
you talk to me  -  -  but you don &apos;t answer my questions .   i guess i &apos;ll have to talk to lieutenant bedsoe . 
yes . 
i &apos;m just trying to place you . 
is it ? 
why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern ?   they were wedged in tight .   they couldn &apos;t get a grip on them .   they would have had much more strength pushing on them . 
on the back it has -  - 
it came from your great ,  great ,  great grandmother ,  isabelle tourez ,  who lived in paris and died on the guillotine in 1789  -  -  alone  -  -  and unmarried .   the ring was given to her by someone who loved her  -  -  but knew that it could never be . 
someone broke into the cavern last night . 
we found him this morning . 
it has to be . 
you stayed here again last night ? 
it was not by choice .   a small matter of a mountain falling down on us .   we were trapped inside .   when the time of the gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands .   what you thought was the end  -  -  was not .   this is the end .   we are the last of our kind ,  macleod . 
would you care for some water ,  conner ? 
do not underestimate the power of your heart .   your dreams live there . 
i guess so . 
dead end -  - it &apos;s a clone .   what about the mustang ? 
sonny &apos;s a fuckup .   if he pulls this off ,  fine -  - life goes on .   but if the cops end up with those disks ,  we cut our losses . 
try to act cool ,  okay ?   he &apos;s gonna think you &apos;re a dick . 
i was there< / u> ,  dennis !   i saw< / u> !   it &apos;s like he wanted< / u> to shoot that cop . 
not if they &apos;re looking at something else . 
we can &apos;t carry all this .   it &apos;s too heavy . 
it &apos;s over .   we have to give up . 
then we might as well die rich . 
you with the cops ? 
dennis ?   i want you to release those people . 
you &apos;ve been in there a long time .  what &apos;re you waiting for ? 
my father needs a doctor .   please< / u> . 
what about my father ? 
it &apos;s a safety room .   if anyone breaks into your house ,  you can hide . 
are you out of your mind ? 
i don &apos;t know< / u> .   talley talked those punks into letting smith out .   he &apos;s fucking us over ,  glen .   that guy is fucking us over . 
what do you want ? 
all right .   now the second one . 
i &apos;ll kill you !   you won &apos;t get the other disk ! 
ow !   shit ! 
what do you want ? 
what &apos;s going on ? 
what are you talking about ,  shot ?   what happened ? 
louise ? 
call jane for me .   she &apos;s at the little thai place . 
i couldn &apos;t find jane .   she wasn &apos;t at the restaurant . 
did you find jane and mandy ? 
i &apos;m talley .   who &apos;s in charge ? 
do it . 
you want me to stick around ,  i could  -  - 
excuse me ?   you< / u> requested our help .   you turned over command  -  - 
it &apos;s mine .   talley . 
those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath !   he kills< / u> people ! 
the kids are in here ! 
i think so . 
i don &apos;t see any people names .   it &apos;s all businesses . 
then you have everything .   you can put them away . 
i have people in york estates right under your nose .   if you do anything< / u> except what i &apos;m telling you ,  you &apos;ll get jane and amanda back in the mail .   we clear on that ? 
you want a blowtorch on your daughter &apos;s< / u> pretty face< / u> ?  ! 
also ,  could you remember to use the service entrance at all times ? 
captain ,  i must take my family .  it is not safe here . 
they are all tutsi cockroaches . 
you want to pay me ? 
ten thousand francs for each one . 
have you requested re - enforcements ? 
you &apos;re fucking black !  you &apos;re not even a nigger ,  you &apos;re african !   they &apos;re not staying to stop this thing .  they &apos;re gonna fly right out of here with their people . 
your police are at the gate ? 
where are they going ? 
you know what the scottish call it ? 
you are a marked man . 
you lie . 
i will try my best george but these days i have no time for rallies or politics .

we have to have a plan . 
our children cannot see us die first .  if the militia comes ,  you must hurry up to the roof .  i will meet you there .

very well .  but if this thing gets worse ,  we must close .  if there &apos;s anything you need ,  call anytime .

and how the hell are we going to do that ? 
if you don &apos;t mind me asking .  .  .  who are you ? 
why in god &apos;s name wasn &apos;t this thing removed years ago ?  ?

she attended the church for years .  a dear woman ,  it was sad to see her decline so rapidly . 
your daughter &apos;s been taken .

what was she afraid of ? 
we &apos;ll never know for sure . 
the rain is letting up . 
well it all depends on how much money you want to spend .   a standard visit would run you about fifty pounds .   that would include myself and an assistant .

this is his first night on earth .   he wants to close the door behind him .  like all lieutenants ,  he covets command .  there &apos;s a gateway to hell through which he can be taken back .   he has to destroy it .

whoa .   name &apos;s hawkins ,  eddie hawkins .  my nickname &apos;s hudson hawk ,  but don &apos;t call me hudson ,  not even as a joke .  the nuns at st .  agnes called me that and they &apos;re the ones who helped make me what i am today .  not a compliment .  .  .

i think you need some help . 
thank you ,  mrs .  rand .   i think you &apos;re every bit as nice as wes says you are . 
some of this native nonsense .  the houngan has his prescription and dr .  maxwell and i have ours . 
 -  -  and when my husband died i felt helpless .  they disobeyed me  -  -  things went from bad to worse .  all my husband &apos;s dreams of good health ,  good sanitation ,  good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him .   then ,  almost accidentally ,  i discovered the secret of how to deal with them .  there was a girl with a baby  -  -  again and again i begged her to boil the drinking water .  she never would .  then i told her the god ,  shango ,  would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it .  she boiled the water from then on .

elena ,  you &apos;re just getting wound up to get wound up . 
i &apos;ll drive you  -  - 
do you think ?  maybe we should call someone  -  - 
yeah .  well ,  we can just  -  - 
well it &apos;s good to see you  -  -  we miss you around the house and all ,  but this st .  peter &apos;s ,  it &apos;s top of the line ,  eh ? 
um ,  paul .  on second thought ,  can you do me a favor and pretend i never said any of that . 
see you . 
 -  -  73
thanks ,  but  -  -  oh ,  i don &apos;t think so .  it &apos;s been kind of a discouraging evening . 
you want coffee or something ? 
jesus ,  let me make it up to you  -  -  i can do better than that ,  honestly  -  - 
oh . 
elena .  elena hood ,  am i right ? 
reverend edwards .  philip edwards .  you came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year . 
now you are being rude . 
reverend edwards . 
arise and shine ,  young hood . 
huh ? 
well ,  uh ,  i don &apos;t ,  it &apos;s really  -  - 
and i have a special feeling too ,  because i do .  it &apos;s special . 
stupid !   is wendy hood your girlfriend ? 
where you going ? 
want some gum ? 
maybe we can mess around .  you know ,  only if you want to .  .  . 
you &apos;re parents at that party ? 
charles . 
hey wendy . 
just thought i &apos;d stop by . 
so far . 
and then i lost him .   in the fog . 
do it again . 
i &apos;m going back to the lodge ,  ellie .  still need to go through some of kay connell &apos;s school records . 
walter byrd killed kay connell .   her things are in the house . 
thanks . 
i &apos;ll call him now . 
she wasn &apos;t happy .   i was someone to talk to . 
he knew exactly what we &apos;d be looking for .  made sure to cover up all his tracks . 
one word to i . a .  and he walks . 
fred duggar ? 
will . 
stuff . 
you want me to take you somewhere ? 
what about him ? 
don &apos;t you pull that shit with me . 
my god .  .  .  so it &apos;s as i always feared .  nothing ,  leading to nothing . 
i was waiting for you .  .  . 
but you asked the wrong questions .  do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality ?  how quickly they perish of their own will . 
you would never give up life .  if the world were reduced to one empty cell ,  on fragile candle ,  you stay alive and study it .  you see too clearly .  you see too much . 
and the vampires of the theatre ? 
you can &apos;t believe i &apos;d leave without her .  armand !  you must save her !  you have no choice . 
but you &apos;re the fairest by far . 
yes .  and i &apos;ll tell you something else !  i &apos;ve met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you . 
you &apos;re spoilt because you &apos;re an only child .  you need a brother .  or i do .  i &apos;m weary of you both . 
not you my dear . 
why does he call you that ? 
claudia !  you did that ? 
he &apos;s dead ,  claudia ,  dead . 
are they my kind louis ?  dolls never change either . 
but this can &apos;t be real .  this is nonsense . 
they use no paint .  and the audience think it is paint . 
oh god !  i love you still ,  that &apos;s the torment of it .  but you know i must leave you louis .  .  . 
you have to ask me for this .  you have to want it ,  do you hear me ? 
you let your overseer run riot ,  work your slaves to the bone .  we &apos;ll start with him . 
your perfect .  your bitter and you &apos;re strong . 
come ,  you &apos;re going to feed now . 
dear god ,  what have i done ? 
you must get into it .  it &apos;s the only safe place for you when the light comes . 
read her thoughts . 
consider yourself lucky .  in paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons .  here all one needs is a pair of fangs . 
they know about us .  they see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses . 
i respect life ,  don &apos;t you see ?  for each and every human life i have respect . 
you fool ,  what have you done ? 
where are we ? 
what do you imagine you are louis ? 
why do you do this lestat ? 
lestat  -  finish this  - 
i didn &apos;t want to kill her . 
i &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here louis .  .  .  i &apos;ve dreamed of your coming .  .  . 
and they frighten you ? 
you believe this ,  don &apos;t you ?  that you &apos;re a vampire ?  you really think .  .  . 
you said the slave had a crucifix .  .  . 
but why did you tell her ? 
dear god .  i &apos;ve failed again ,  haven &apos;t i ? 
and the child who did die ? 
wait .  .  . did you say off - season ? 
duh .  the next couple of days is gonna be rough ,  but we &apos;ll make it . 
i don &apos;t know ,  man .  maybe we should keep going ,  find a phone  -  - 
there &apos;s a storm comin &apos; ,  titus .  no boats are going out . 
no means yes . 
you gotta sell his butt on the bahamas ? 
but ,  he said he &apos;d try . 
remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin &apos; i do for a weekend once every ten years . 
karaoke  -  -  perfect . 
i &apos;m not crazy .  .  . i &apos;m not crazy .  he &apos;s here .  .  .   we &apos;ve got to get to the radio and call for help . 
be careful ,  julie . 
there &apos;s no way to lock it . 
yeah . 
every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good - friend thing first . 
ray ,  i can &apos;t .  .  . 
we &apos;d have a long weekend just to sit in the sun ,  drink fruity drinks ,  and swim ,  and .  .  .   you know .  .  . 
the shower again ? 
it was one year ago .  .  . 
i &apos;m trying .  i really am .  .  . sometimes i don &apos;t even know why i came up here in the first place . 
nah .  i &apos;ll probably just be here studying for finals .  the joys of summer school .  .  .   are you okay ? 
this was not my idea . 
deep breaths  -  - 
you &apos;ve got a better chance of getting hit by lightning . 
what do you mean ,  julie ? 
oh ,  will !  i &apos;m sorry . 
what ?  what are you talking about ?  where ? 
i trusted you . 
 .  .  . why ? 
if you can say all you gotta say in a minute then i don &apos;t wanna hear it . 
ain &apos;t nothin &apos; free in this world .  everybody says it ,  and it &apos;s true .   i wanted you all to have a good trip . 
oooh ,  the mainland  -  - 
tha &apos;s it .   i &apos;ve decided .   i &apos;m changing my major to finance .   and going to wall street . 
you sure you didn &apos;t pick up my hair tie ? 
somebody .  .  . is a sick ,  fingerpainting psycho . 
i &apos;ll come with you . 
hell ,  that &apos;s worth three ,  easy .  and you got your waiting period . 
cool . 
there &apos;s ten people on this whole island and they &apos;re all gonna end up in this jacuzzi with us . 
we &apos;ll only be a second ,  okay ? 
where &apos;d estes go ? 
he is exhausted . 
i need your advice  something has happened  mr .   jacks 
if the wind shifts ,  if the sirocco blows  -  -  the hot wind from the south  -  -  all danger will be over in twenty - four hours . 
the enemy is in retreat .  there will be no more fighting here .   i came here to visit the crypts .  my wife was buried here .  what happened to the bodies ? 
i &apos;m afraid so .  there were rumors people were aroused .  some feared restlessness among the dead you know ,  the old superstitions . 
i adore hearing thea sing  -  -  but my poor head &apos;s beginning to ache .   i &apos;m so sorry . 
tell me about them ,  thea .  they have great wings end long teeth  -  - 
i have been troubled about you .  i want you to know that my room is just downstairs  -  -   you have only to cry out if you are ill  or frightened . 
miss wollsten shares the room with you ? 
it &apos;s getting dark .  i can &apos;t leave now . 
cathy  -  how does it feel to have a father ? 
what is it  -  -  what are you talking about ? 
you should sleep ,  cathy .  lie down and close your eyes .  try to forget everything . 
they were talking about the vrykolakas this morning .  cathy ,  that &apos;s what you are  a weak ,  pale ,  half - dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live . 
your father knew it too .  but he was never sure how much was pretense . 
you will not say one single word .  i know your secret . 
i &apos;ve always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours  but this ,  cathy  -  -  even i would never have believed it is of you . 
you &apos;ve been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man   working at him   turning him against thea . 
no .  no .  i won &apos;t believe it .  he &apos;s not dead . 
he sleeps quietly .  he died with a wine glass in his hand  -  -  he died laughing  -  -  a brave man ,  drossos ,  like his father before him . 
i don &apos;t want to be buried alive .  if i die i want to be sure  -  quite sure . 
no ,  i want more than that .  i beg you general ,  make sure  -  - drive a knife through my heart  -  -  anything . 
theodosia . 
your daughter is ill . 
was she ill before that girl came into your household ? 
you know that sound ,  oliver ? 
do you mind if i go with you ? 
she was beautiful .  there was blood between her family and my kin .  but that did not stop me from taking her when i saw her beauty ,  nor did it stop her from loving me . 
i had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately  why ? 
i have had command for the last time  - 
good morning ,  sir .

what &apos;s the matter with him .  i never saw nick act like that before . 
well then ,  why am i seeing all these strange things ?

oh ,  i had another tussle with potter today . 
father ,  did i act like that when i graduated from high school ? 
this town is no place for any man unless he &apos;s willing to crawl to potter .  you &apos;ve got talent ,  son .  you get yourself an education .  then get out of here . 
old building and loan pal ,  huh  .   .   .

you wouldn &apos;t mind living in the nicest house in town ,  buying your wife a lot of fine clothes ,  a couple of business trips to new york a year ,  maybe once in a while europe .  you wouldn &apos;t mind that ,  would you ,  george ? 
sure ,  sure ,  sure .  you go on home and talk about it to your wife . 
i have a big deal coming up that &apos;s going to make us all rich .  george ,  you remember that night in martini &apos;s bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans ?

they &apos;re way downtown .  they &apos;d be on my side ,  too . 
my mother just called you ?  well ,  how did she know ?

let &apos;s see  -  -  you got a minute ? 
y &apos;know ,  brody  -  -  for the first time in years it &apos;s worth putting money into this town . 
is that what it is ?   dollars ?  money ?   i &apos;ll pay for it .   take it out of my salary . 
the whale &apos;s mouth ?

the goddamn smell is always the same .  
what &apos;s wrong ? 
honey ,  this is nothing .  .  . i don &apos;t know what it is .   what did they .  .  .  . 
they have no right to treat you like that .   you &apos;ve given them every -  thing .   for four years ,  you &apos;ve protected this town ,  the people on this island .  .  .  . 
i know you did .  .  .  . 
what is it ?   what &apos;s the matter ? 
we &apos;re alone . 
of course i can ,  but can &apos;t it wait ?  these things cost money ,  and this town doesn &apos;t have much money . 
we have done something  -  -  hell ,  we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach  -  -  it &apos;s the only one in 2000 miles ,  y &apos;know . 
and i stood by while you told the people from ramada and marriott that if they put up a hotel they &apos;d need $800 , 000 worth of steel net around their beaches !   in new england ?  we all lost on that one . 
bullshit . 
that &apos;s it .   just do it ,  all right ?

the lighthouse is a make - out spot . 
i told you ,  remember ?

eddie ,  can we do that ?   can we go skiing ?   we can use my uncle &apos;s boat .   eddie ?

you don &apos;t wanna sit here any more ,  sweetheart  .  .

that &apos;s the girl i love . 
i &apos;ve got a 24 hour a day reminder of roger ,  for the rest of my life .  i have had three lovers in four years ,  all boring ,  all achingly self - sufficient all friends of yours i might add ,  and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath .   look at me ,  laurel ,  look at me .   i &apos;m the oldest 26 year old in the world !   how do i look ?

that &apos;s an answer . 
thanks for coming . 
you &apos;re with the sports people on the plane ,  right ? 
and i can &apos;t say his name without laughing i want to eat him up .  i want to say goodbye to every bad thought i ever had about relationships .   i mean ,  i crave this guy .  .  .  and yet .  .  .  why .  .  .  why did i have that affair this weekend ?   does that mean i &apos;m not in love with my boyfriend ? 
oh ,  tell the story . 
that &apos;s when you need to cement ,  and define define define . 
marcee .   how &apos;s my favorite player &apos;s wife ? 
how can i make your life better ? 
marcee  -  - 
aw shit .  .  . the crowded restaurant .  .  .  so there &apos;s no scene .  .  . 
 .  .  .  dick ? 
you wanted smaller . 
jerry  -  - 
you said  &quot; fuck &quot;  . 
show me the animal ,  jerry ! 
this is how you make dinosaurs ? 
well ,  i &apos;m no aviation specialist .  but i do know it &apos;s hell of a lot lower than anyone else . 
you look good . 
fine .  .  . and when the tricyclatops comes after you ,  don &apos;t come crying to me . 
what did you say ? 
young adult . 
i know you liked ben .  i had no right to .  .  . 
we can &apos;t just stop looking .  eric and dr .  grant are out there somewhere . 
paul !  where is he ?  can you see him ? 
he could have died . 
you see ,  that &apos;s just the thing .  paul and i have special permission to fly low . 
i thought we weren &apos;t suppose to yell . 
we have to keep looking for dad .  we have to . 
i dont know . 
even with what i pay you ,  you could get a better bag . 
they never got that big . 
good luck with the fund raising . 
okay .  goodbye ,  ellie . 
when i met you ,  i thought that one day millions of years ago ,  all the dinosaurs became extinct .  wiped out .  but you told me otherwise .  when conditions changed ,  dinosaurs changed .  they became other things .  they evolved . 
found this ,  but the battery &apos;s dead . 
we need to head for the coast . 
we climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean .  with any luck ,  the costa rican coast guard will pick us up . 
what can i do for you ,  mr .  kirby ? 
that &apos;s hard to believe . 
how did you know ? 
how do you mean ? 
you are an academic . 
what ? 
what are you talking about ? 
no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no ,  no  .   .   . 
are you out of your mind ?   i still have nightmares ,  my reputation &apos;s a joke ,  my leg is shot  -  -  you think i need more of that ? 
i &apos;m not going ,  john . 
do you have chromium tapes ?   the others fog in high - 
that was a pair bond !   a family group ,  even ,  long after that infant was nestbound ! 
the empty shells are crushed and trampled .   the young stay in the birth environment ,  that &apos;s conclusive ! 
and let &apos;s forget about the high hide .  we can &apos;t do this kind of work up in a tower ,  we need to be out in the field ,  as close to the animals as possible . 
i can &apos;t tell you .   but i &apos;ll be back within a week . 
if your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to hard copy ,  i hardly see how i am to -  - 
do you see any family resemblance here ? 
no more smoking .   we leave no scent of any kind .   no hair tonics ,  no cologne ,  seal all our food in plastic bags .   we will observe and document ,  but we will not interact . 
oh ,  god . 
these formations .   they &apos;re dried  -  - 
that must be interesting .   what drew you there ? 
ruining everything ,  that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .   you could choke on the diesel smoke already ! 
hold it down ,  nick ! 
what are you - 
uh  -   -  mr .  hammond  -   - 
visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage . 
phones are out too . 
we &apos;re talking ,  my dear ,  about a calculated risk ,  which is the only option left to us .   we will never find the command nedry used .   he covered his tracks far too well ,  and i think it &apos;s obvious he &apos;s not coming back .   so shutting down the system  -   - 
are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours ?  i mean ,  what &apos;s hanging us up ? 
but would we get the phones back ? 
imbalance ,  disorientation ,  labored breathing .   seems to happen about every six weeks or so . 
sure .   i &apos;ve got a gas powered jeep .   i can drop her at the visitor &apos;s center before i make the boat with the others . 
did i say jerk ? 
there you are .   out you come . 
carousel . 
the taphonomy sure looks that way . 
cheap ,  cheap ,  cheap . 
oh my god ,  they do not !   they don &apos;t smell . 
anything else ,  you old fossil ? 
and what are those ? 
ellie ,  they &apos;re absolutely  -   -  they &apos;re moving in herds .  they do move in herds ! 
 -   -  a gizzard  -   - 
they show extreme intelligence ,  even problem solving .  especially the big one .   we bred eight originally ,  but when she came in ,  she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others .   that one  -   - when she looks at you ,  you can see she &apos;s thinking  working things out .   she &apos;s the reason we have to feed  &apos;em like this .  she had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came . 
dr .  sattler ,  i &apos;ve seen a lot of animal attacks .   people just disappear .   no blood ,  no trace .    that &apos;s the way it happens . 
come on ,  let &apos;s go . 
oh my god .   aw ,  god . 
i know ,  it &apos;s very exciting . 
it &apos;s anti - nature . 
if two experts sign off on the island ,  the insurance guys &apos;ll back off .   i already got ian malcolm ,  but they think he &apos;s too trendy .   they want alan grant . 
i can &apos;t see . 
are they heavy ? 
you got any kids ? 
blood temperature feels like high eighties . 
mr .  hammond ,  i &apos;ve decided not to endorse your park . 
hear that ?   are you hearing this ? 
it &apos;s am easy catch ,  you let  -   -  go  -   -  you do the counting ,  you count it ,  tim .   one ,  two ,  three  -  -  you do all the counting ,  okay ? 
you &apos;ll have to get use to dr .  malcolm !   he suffers from a deplorable excess of personality ,  especially for a mathematician ! 
a load ,  if i may say so .  of fashionable number crunching ,  thats all it is ! 
i hate trees ! 
that &apos;s not funny . 
that &apos;s not true .  .  . 
there doesn &apos;t seem to be any water damage .  kind of cozy ,  actually . 
hello ? 
this is janet davenport  -  -  i &apos;m the realtor . 
what ? 
i can &apos;t wait to hear your opening argument .   &quot; ladies and gentlemen of the jury .  .  .  the defense will prove that jason voorhees did not kill all of these people .  they ,  in fact ,  committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard .  .  .  &quot; 
what &apos;s going on ? 
what happened ? 
who ? 
a house ? 
this is bad ,  joe .  the prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists .  they &apos;ll argue exactly the opposite .  they &apos;ll say he &apos;s just pretending to be catatonic and he &apos;s completely sane . 
that &apos;s the problem with this case .  everyone thinks they know jason &apos;s life story .  but they don &apos;t .  what you &apos;re remembering is a _movie_ .  fiction .  in the movie ,  jason &apos;s mother runs around ,  killing people after jason drowns in crystal lake
what do you want  -  -  a tidy psychological profile ?  you want to hear that i was falsely accused of a crime i didn &apos;t commit .  .  .  and that &apos;s driven me to defend others ?  or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings .  .  .  talk about my childhood .  .  . 
not much here .  jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia .  .  .  that &apos;s about it . 
there &apos;s nothing to see here .  he sleeps .  .  .  we record it .  that &apos;s all that happens . 
see this ? 
it &apos;s all right .  i &apos;m simply in shock .  .  .  this is what happens to people when they experience events they can &apos;t understand or comprehend .  the mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it &apos;s been exposed to .   i &apos;m going to need a lot of therapy . 
you saw him ? 
great .  now there &apos;s _two_ serial killers on the loose . 
krueger &apos;s in the real world .  .  .  maybe he &apos;s mortal ,  like us . 
my assistants ,  i presume . 
i read the one about the penal colony . 
you work in the cemetery . 
if i don &apos;t see you later  -  -  go to my house and find my notebooks  -  -  and destroy them .   all my manuscripts  -  -  just burn them .  please . 
a true friend would do it . 
he &apos;s usually in the storage room sorting things out .   he can &apos;t close the file on a case until he has the concluding report . 
it &apos;s my place to offer advice ,  not yours  -  -  and by advising the chief clerk of your unpunctuality it &apos;s certainly not my situation that &apos;s compromised ,  if that &apos;s what you &apos;re implying . 
you wanted to see me ,  sir . 
well ,  i  -  - 
i understand you fancy yourself an author . 
the orlac< / u> claim . 
he wasn &apos;t robbed .   he was identified by his wallet . 
are you free tonight ? 
the day he died ,  eduard was called up to the castle .   did you know that ? 
and you still maintain  -  -  what ?  that he was murdered . 
yes  -  -  which is why  &quot; quiet ,  dependable people &quot;  have to take charge of their own lives . 
i &apos;m collecting eduard &apos;s things .  if there &apos;s anything you want ,  take it or i &apos;ll give it to charity . 
they &apos;re not obliged to tell . 
of course he is  -  -  the castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark .   people disappear up there regularly .    if you want to lie in wait for someone ,  that &apos;s the place to do it . 
how often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records ? 
gabriela  .  .  .  ? 
only two steps back ?   even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that . 
i know how they reward failure .  if they saw this i &apos;d be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon  -  -  with all the others . 
engaged in the manufacture and distribution of  .  .  .  pills and so forth . 
would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close ? 
was he depressed ? 
he might have had a drink or two ,  despite what you think . 
his landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to . 
he wasn &apos;t a lonely man ,  though . 
still ,  we &apos;re probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings . 
 -  -  gabriela ,  on the other hand ,  had made an enemy of this man burgel . 
the fact that it &apos;s live bodies you practice your trade on doesn &apos;t seem to matter to you . 
what &apos;s the matter ? 
it &apos;s gone out so quickly ? 
ludwig . 
they keep switching us from department to department .   he doesn &apos;t mind because he can &apos;t sit still . 
i thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the albert hall .  we &apos;ll take out a full page ad in variety  -   &quot; the lord darrow benefit screening &quot;  .  we &apos;ll invite the king of england  -  hell ,  we &apos;ll get the whole royal family along !  it &apos;d be good for them and good for us ! 
god ,  you &apos;re so obnoxious !  our work happens to be of great anthropological value ! 
i &apos;m sorry  .  .  . 
i want to thank you . 
jack ! 
oh jesus  .  .  .  you took it . 
barricade the gates !  quick ! 
you are most kind .  we will be proud to assist you ! 
tell me mr ginting  -  are there any parts of your country where people still wear  .  .  .  native costume ? 
listen buddy !  cut the crap !  we &apos;re looking for ann ,  not making a goddamn movie ! 
hey !  i thought these things were supposed to be extinct ! 
they were just tasting the berries . 
set up the camera boys !  get a shot of me comin &apos; ashore ! 
are you nervous jack ? 
did you fear for your life ? 
it must have been terrifying ? 
why ? 
arlyn ,  just tell me ,  did jane have a dumper ,  one of her regular johns ? 
i do not love him . 
well i have to close up now . 
why isn &apos;t he locked up ? 
can &apos;t we talk together reasonably ,  just  -  -  ordinarily ?   i know you &apos;re expecting some kind of  -  -  extravagant behavior ,  but believe me  -  -  do you believe me ?   -  - 
i &apos;m not going to hurt you ,  absolutely ,  i &apos;m not . 
excuse me miss daniel ? 
honest ? 
you &apos;re not police or fbi; you &apos;re just a private investigator ? 
and you just want to ask me a few questions ? 
if i was taking calls full time would i be living in this kip ?  i &apos;d be back on park avenue; i could support the whole national guard ! 
well could i have them back now hon ?   -  -  those tape recordings you &apos;ve got downstairs  -  -  ok ?   -  -  and if you want you can have a good time and i &apos;ll have a good time and -  - 
i thought you could trick me for those tapes .  don &apos;t you get lonely in that little green room ?  or let me get you someone; i have terrific friends ,  wild . 
rounds ,  what are they ?   -  -  don &apos;t watch me ,  keep talking . 
you asked me where i got that date with the dumper  -  -  frank sent me on it . 
about the dumper ,  didn &apos;t he tell you that ? 
you said it was ! 
then maybe arlyn page knew the dumper too . 
the same as jane mckenna . 
the next few weeks i would like to know where you are all the time . 
how can you do it to yourself ? 
i am scared .  the things i do .  the things i could do to you . 
i can talk it over; possibly i can get the money .  when are you meeting the man ? 
it &apos;s a beautiful day in tuscarora  -  i don &apos;t envy you that humidity in the city . 
all right .  all right  -  -   john ,  just sit tight will you ?  i &apos;ll read your report ,  i &apos;ll discuss it with the others .  i &apos;ll be back next thursday ,  we &apos;ll talk the whole thing over then .  nothing til thursday ,  all right ? 
no . 
that &apos;s how the other one died ,  you know .  in the water . 
mr .  kramer ? 
okay .  .  . same as usual .  .  . 
yeah ? 
you get a new fence . 
look ,  i &apos;m sorry i yelled ,  okay ? 
i want a pizza . 
now go to sleep .   it &apos;s very late . 
ohhh .  .  . ohhhh .  .  . ohhhhh .  .  . 
are you going to get remarried ? 
what don &apos;t you understand ,  pal ? 
your mom . 
did you wish to ? 
mrs .  kramer ,  do you love your child ? 
yes .  .  . look ,  during the last five years we were married ,  i had .  .  . i was getting more and more .  .  . unhappy ,  more and more frustrated .   i needed to talk to somebody .   i needed to find out if it was me ,  if i was going crazy or what .   but every time i turned to ted -  - my ex - husband ,  he couldn &apos;t handle it .   he became very .  .  . i don &apos;t know ,  very threatened .   i mean ,  when -  ever i would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack .   anyway ,  we became more and more separate  .  .  . more and more isolated from one another .   finally ,  i had no other choice ,  i had to leave .  and because of my ex - husband &apos;s attitude -  - his unwillingness to deal with my feelings ,  i had come to have almost no self -  esteem .  .  .   at the time i left ,  i sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me -  - that my son would be better off without me .   it was only when i got to california and started into therapy i began to realize i wasn &apos;t a terrible person .   and that just because i needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child ,  that didn &apos;t make me unfit to be a mother . 
now then ,  mr .  o &apos;connor ,  how long did ted kramer work for you ? 
ted was a good worker .   but ,  ah .  .  .   .  .  .  after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own ,  things started to change .  look ,  i know he had problems ,  i understand that .   i &apos;ve got problems ,  everybody &apos;s got problems .   but i &apos;ve got a shop to run ,  i can &apos;t let that kind of thing get in the way .  .  .   i guess i felt that ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office . 
there might be something at j .  walter thompson .   but .  .  .    .  .  . i don &apos;t think they &apos;re really serious .   the position &apos;s been open for two months and .  .  .   they may just be on a fishing expedition .   i &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be much happier if you wait until after the first -  - 
now then ,  mrs .  kramer ,  you said you were married seven years .  is that correct ? 
i don &apos;t recall . 
i took two thousand out of the savings account .   that was what i had in the bank when we got married . 
ted ,  you &apos;re not listening to me .  it &apos;s over ,  finished . 
i can &apos;t help but feel somehow .  .  .  it &apos;s my fault .   i keep thinking i could &apos;ve done something -  -  stopped it .  .  . 
i &apos;ve seen him . 
ted ,  when we got married it was because i was twenty - seven years old and i thought i should get married and .  .  . when i had billy it was because i thought i should have a baby .  .  . and i guess all i did was mess up my life and your life and -  - 
look ,  it &apos;s none of my business ,  so you can tell me to butt out ,  okay ?   but if you want my advice ,  you &apos;ll send billy away to stay with relatives for a while .   just until you get yourself straightened out . 
and ? 
three months .   how can you tell ? 
look ,  she walked out on her own child ,  right ?   that &apos;s desertion ,  right ?  mr .  shaunessy ,  i &apos;m telling you it &apos;s an open and shut case . 
oh ,  christ ! 
i lost him ?   i lost him ? 
good christ ,  joanna ,  just get the hell out of my life . 
all right ,  thelma ,  you want to know what &apos;s going on ?   i &apos;ll tell you what &apos;s going on .   i &apos;ll tell you exactly what &apos;s going on . 
two .   she is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it .   thelma ,  do you know where i could be in this business if i had a wife that entertained or went out socially -  - 
y &apos;know something thelma -  - you are the typhoid mary of divorce .  i mean it .   joanna and i never had any trouble until you and charley split up . 
what are you going to do ? 
how many onions does it say to use ? 
i didn &apos;t say i &apos;m going to die ,  but if i should -  - 
huh .  .   . hello ? 
ted ,  what are you talking about ?  ! 
we must go ,  holiness . 
all quiet ? 
where are you from ? 
mama ,  my story . 
you were a beautiful baby .  so calm . 
i will buy them for you . 
you must also do something about the public meetings .  i see this ,  memorandum circulating ,  with tibetan grievances . 
have you heard the terms of the seventeen point agreement ? 
and the united nations ?  surely ? 
ngabo did not have the state seal .  he could not sign . 
general chiang chin - wu ,  the chinese representative ,  is en route to dromo .  he is coming to meet you . 
cow . 
can i save the sheep from going to the market ?  so they don &apos;t die . 
do i have money ? 
in the pacific ocean . 
what can i do ?  i am only a boy . 
quite simple .  yes .  good . 
one country did sponsor the resolution .  a land called  &quot; el salvador &quot;  . 
did you ever doubt it ? 
please ,  come in ,  so cold . 
i have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments .  industrial progress .  great efficiency .  your people are capable and courteous . 
i have news .  the regent has resigned his post . 
we have enemies . 
these are dangerous times .  they want the dalai lama to lead them . 
you will not come ? 
you must study very hard ,  do not neglect the holy things during this time . 
you have grown up very good . 
tell me . 
hmm . 
much too young . 
you killed him . 
i haven &apos;t broken any laws . 
it seems like we &apos;re getting lower . 
why are we landing ? 
go !  !  ! 
keystone what ? 
jesus christ !  ! 
i &apos;m laying a spring trap ! 
i brought a pork chop ,  maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck . 
what &apos;s that ? 
just spit him back out .   some shall live ,  some shall die ,  arbitrarily ,  sound like any higher power we know ? 
you probably do< / u> want to be killed by it ,  that was you trying to meet your maker . 
no ! 
this time ,  i &apos;m< / u> gonna kick your ass . 
hector .   the big one has no sense of humor .   and since he &apos;s< / u> the one who decides whether you get to play ,  try not to be your obnoxious self . 
but they &apos;re nighttime hunters ,  hector ,  he &apos;d probably be on land now anyway . 
none of us actually saw< / u> anything .   i realize this sir ,  but something flipped us over ,  i doubt very much it was a mink . 
two years married ,  divorced ,  used to be a lawyer ,  quit ,  i &apos;m still waiting on his sperm count . 
hector .   what you just did .  .  .  there was at least some sort of a death wish going on . 
i &apos;m an empty man ,  kelly ,  wealth has robbed me of the dream in life ,  i sit here broken ,  a hollow sack -  - 
eh .   fuck it . 
did you make anything of the tooth ? 
if this is who i think< / u> it is .   it is< / u> . 
what are you doing ? 
he thinks they &apos;re what ? 
what ? 
you wanna kill yourself ,  that it ,  you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide ? 
it can &apos;t work . 
i &apos;m ready when you are . 
i can &apos;t .   i &apos;ll get hector !  ! 
thanks for your help . 
he just came up screaming . 
what< / u> is< / u> that< / u> ? 
we don &apos;t mean to invade your privacy but .  .  .  was he ill ,  was he sick ? 
with what ? 
why does everybody insult my intelligence ,  i have intelligence ,  intelligent people eat twinkies . 
he said he knew it when he looked into their eyes . 
are you alright ? 
are you okay ? 
shit ,  shit ,  shit ,  shit ,  shit . 
i had a great time last night .  again . 
kevin ,  as long as we .  .  .   what was that last part ? 
this was myra &apos;s idea ,  wasn &apos;t it ?  get me out of the office for a few days ,  until -  -

fbi ,  catherine ,  you &apos;re safe .

what you &apos;re doing ,  miss starling ,  is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview ,  and refusing to share information with me .  for the third time ! 
your instructions are what i &apos;m giving you now .  jack crawford answers to the director ,  and the director answers to me .  my god ,  crawford &apos;s losing it .  .  .  !  he shouldn &apos;t even be on this ,  with his wife sick as she is .  .  .  how the hell did you get in here ,  anyway ?  he gave you  -  what ?  some kind of special id ?  let &apos;s have it . 
mr .  krendler .  .  .  dr .  lecter trusts me .  or at least ,  he used to .  if i could just  - 
but then he had to cover up ,  make her seem just like all the rest of them .  that &apos;s what lecter was hinting ! 
you &apos;re playing a piano ,  miss starling ? 
mr .  gordon ,  did you know fredrica when she worked for mrs .  lippman ?

i wanted to talk to you about that . 
the odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand . 
drachmas ,  i hope .  i would feel safer with a chicken drumstick .  they could do more harm than good . 
ed can run fast ,  talk fast ,  eat fast ,  and play cards fast ,  but he &apos;s fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz . 
let me tell you about hatchet harry .  once there was this geezer called smithy robinson who worked for harry .  it was rumoured that he was on the take .  harry invited smithy round for an explanation .  smithy didn &apos;t do a very good job .  within a minute harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand ,  which happened to be a fifteen - inch black rubber cock .  he then proceeded to batter poor smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go  .   .   .  hence ,  hatchet harry is a man you pay if you owe . 
i think he &apos;s still alive .  he &apos;s got claret coming out of him somewhere .  what did they want with a traffic warden ? 
scarface ,  i have watched scarface .  you want to know how to do a drug deal ,  you watch scarface !

that &apos;s it all done ,  we are off . 
you see it &apos;s not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters .

that there is no such thing as evil with a capital  &quot; e .  &quot;

mother  -  -   ? 
why would you ask now ?   you never asked before ! 
your majesty .  .  . 
then you are a fool  -  -  a fool who has never lost a son .   what gives you the right to judge me ,  to play god with the lives of others ?   is it because you are so much holier than everyone else ?  ! 
you can do it . 
go on . 
but aramis  -  -   !   phillippe can learn in time ,  but  -  - 
remember ,  phillippe .  .  .  nobility is born in the heart . 
bloody hell .  .  . 
once you are through ,  don &apos;t stop until you reach the river . 
please revel with me ,  aramis ,  i need my spirits lifted .   i &apos;m old ,  i &apos;m weak ,  my strength is gone  -  - 
it is a weighty problem ,  aramis  -  -  but perhaps you should leave it to this secret general of the jesuits ,  whoever he might be . 
aramis !   athos !   he looks exactly like .  .  .  exactly like .  .  . 
but why ? 
we go someplace dangerous . 
he gets one day of confession each year .   today is the day . 
it is honor you serve ,  and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor ! 
phillippe .  .  .  there is something i hope you understand .   terrible cruelty has been used against you .  and .  .  .  you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it . 
you look so sad .   is it something i have done ? 
is that the king of king you wish me to be ?   or do you say this because of your son ? 
phillippe .  .  .  ? 
are you hungry ? 
a personal nature ? 
you dare criticize my father ?  !   or lecture me ?  ! 
not once have i ever asked anything for myself .   i ask now .   forgive this man ,  this prisoner .  .  .  your brother . 
where is michelle ? 
continue . 
what number did you tear out ? 
who was athos seeking ?   tell me !  did he try to enter the palace ? 
do you want athos arrested ,  your majesty ? 
now .   where is d &apos;artagnan ? 
i would have said it was impossible ,  but i believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful . 
sire !   i  -  -  how did you  -  - 
the food doesn &apos;t please you ? 
you are beautiful .   you know you are . 
it &apos;s marvosa  -

why did you set me up ? 
jimmy ,  do you realize what you did ?  man that &apos;s like death penalty shit  - 
oh man .  .  . what happened ? 
i &apos;ve got a better idea .  .  . 
ok ,  i &apos;m logged on to the municipal network .   i &apos;m showing sixteen people with the name sarah williams in l . a .  county .   none of them live in hollywood .   do you remember the address ? 
i don &apos;t ,  but i &apos;m pretty sure .  it &apos;s a long story but i cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe .   if they start a trace it will be to a pic &apos;n &apos;save on pico . 
where am i going ? 
what about him ? 
they tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a princeton student .   he gave them a recipe for potato chip dip . 
where ? 
he thinks you want him to look at evidence . 
let &apos;s go to bed .  i &apos;ll rub your back . 
that &apos;s not entirely true ,  will .  it &apos;s the way you think . 
if you can &apos;t look anymore ,  i understand .  .  . 
don &apos;t expect too much from me ,  jack ,  all right ?   we &apos;ll get him one way or the other . 
he makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time . 
you think i &apos;m gonna spot him  &apos;across a crowded room ?  &apos;  that &apos;s ezio pinza you &apos;re thinking about .   the tooth fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky .  he won &apos;t stop . 
because he has a genuine taste for it ,  jack . 
sarah ,  order a chopper .  i want the next thing smoking and i don &apos;t care whose .  ours .  dcpd .   or the marines .  then call documents .  tell them to scramble a team .  i want everybody moving in five minutes .   dr .  chilton ,  please do not handle the note .  i have a documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up . 
we know the tooth fairy reads the tattler .  the stuff about me and lector ?  i don &apos;t know any other paper that carried it .  .  . 
can we still get lecktor &apos;s message out of the paper ? 
you mean jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered ? 
it &apos;s getting late and .  .  . 
it &apos;s the guard in the storeroom . 
i &apos;ll cover the back . 
ms .  mcclain ,  i &apos;m francis dollarhyde .  i came about the low light level infrared film stock .

do you see ? 
mrs .  jacobi after her changing .   the dragon rampant .  do you see ? 
do you see ? 
you did very well .   i apologize for the crude images .   next time i &apos;ll have film stock that doesn &apos;t need lights . 
yes ? 
i want to see lecktor now . 
she doesn &apos;t have a rolodex . 
3680 desoto highway .  marathon ,  florida . 
he &apos;s very strong physically . 
that &apos;s all we know about .   most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center .  a suck mark .  these don &apos;t .  so ,  for him ,  biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior .   you could try emergency room personnel ,  treatment for bite wounds .  i know that &apos;s pretty thin .  .  .   he bites a lot . 
it &apos;s me .  i &apos;ll call you tomorrow ,  sweetheart .  go back to sleep .   i love you .  .  .

a layman .  .  .  ,  layman .  interesting term .  so many experts on government grants .  and you say you &apos;re a  &apos;layman ?  &apos; but it was you who caught me ,  wasn &apos;t it ,  will ?  do you know how you did it &apos;
yes ,  i thought so . 
chilton ?  gruesome ,  isn &apos;t he ?  he fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle .   he actually tries to give me a thematic and apperception test .  hah .  sat there waiting for mf - 13 to come up .  it &apos;s a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground .   i was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation .  i laughed in his face .   never mind ,  it &apos;s boring . 
let me have them ,  and i might consider it . 
what were the yards like ? 
 .  .  . if he &apos;s smart he &apos;ll approach from the front ,  pass ,  and take you from the back .  how well do you hear ? 
you show a lot of promise .  .  .  but .  .  .  my concern is i don &apos;t know where to book you .   you &apos;re not a stand - up .  .  .  your act doesn &apos;t exactly translate to films .  .  .  help me .  .  .  where do you see yourself ?

eleven to seven he blows it . 
if we were for real ,  and knew our shit ,  we &apos;d fade this one .  .  . 
a c . i .  we cut loose to your joint interagency task force .   name of alonzo stevens .   now ,  he &apos;s your informant .   stevens ,  called us .   i haven &apos;t spoken to him for six months .  i do not know what case you have him on .   i do not know what he is talking about .   but whatever he is doing for you ,  it sounds like it is going bad .   right now .  .  . 
guy &apos;s involved in a  &quot; meet &quot;  .  .  . 
that &apos;s right . 
omgs ,  mongols ,  nazi low - riders ,  prison gangs ? 
how ? 
never heard of him . 
reverse undercover ?   we supply to them ? 
you mean with the flowers .  .  .  ? 
they &apos;ve been targeted .   and pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now . 
i run down the numbers .   nothing is very negotiable .   small loads ?   we pay three thousand a ki .  we pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent .   the next ten percent on u . s .  landfall . 
then what were we talking to you for ? 
they said they wouldn &apos;t hurt them ,  wouldn &apos;t hurt them if .  .  . 
beg pardon ,  ma &apos;am ? 
you &apos;re such a doll .  i hate money ,  don &apos;t you ?  god ,  it &apos;s been fun . 
must be some mess back there . 
i &apos;m sorry .  i thought you were  -  -  never mind  -  -  i &apos;ve never actually been there ,  but let me see ,  you take the seventh avenue subway ,  i think ,  to the end of the line .  .  . 
maybe we should take a little nap ,  see what happens ? 
if you didn &apos;t talk so much ,  maybe you could think more . 
there &apos;s an e in money .  if that &apos;s your word . 
that is one hell of a shirt .  i bet you paid a pretty price for it ,  am i right ? 
forget it . 
i drug in a cot ,  if you want to stay . 
joe  -  -  do me one favor  -  -  this is my place ,  am i wrong ?  you know ,  in my own place my name ain &apos;t ratso .  i mean it so happens my name is enrico salvatore rizzo . 
the two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk .  that &apos;s a known fact .  if i can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out . 
in florida ,  they come smooth ,  ready to eat .  down there ,  your only problem is ,  diet - wise ,  you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin .  tough ,  hey ? 
miami beach is the only place for a real hustler .  florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world .  they lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes . 
where &apos;d that come from ? 
now i &apos;m here .  i &apos;m in new york city .  getting picked for things .  don &apos;t you see what i &apos;m driving at ? 
did i say that ?  did i ?   it don &apos;t say nothing about you .  .  . 
tell her ,  ratso . 
they wrong ? 
but thanks .   hey ,  joe ,  don &apos;t get sore about this or anything .  you promise ? 
just when everything &apos;s going my way ,  you gotta pull a stunt like this . 
keep the goddam blanket on . 
hey  -  -  whatsa matter ? 
thanks ,  joe . 
sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago .  there was this war ,  there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die .  but he didn &apos;t .  isn &apos;t that amusing ? 
what you got me up here for ? 
you got it . 
sold .  let &apos;s go . 
he fell .  hey ,  fella ,  you fell .  is he all right ? 
 &apos;figgers . 
the kids ?  why are they .  .  .

how much you pay this joker .  .  .  this cab driver ? 
girlfriend ? 
jeez ,  she used to say i was the lucky one . 
feeling all right ? 
but he was eating lunch a mile away when the turk smashed into killed himself . 
you just got to get yourself a good lawyer .   and some money .  .  .  talk to max .   he &apos;s been in the longest . 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
no .  .  .  it looks like your going to have a new court . 
max ,  sit down .  you &apos;re in no shape to kill anybody . 
it &apos;s already been cut . 
 .  .  . his money  -  steal that ,  you steal his blood .  .  .  could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched ?   if we knew where he hid it .   anyway ,  steal from him they &apos;d pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways .   we couldn &apos;t hide it anywhere . 
billy ,  what &apos;s the matter ? 
susan  -  forget it .  go get us a seat on the plane .  now . 
billy  -  you &apos;ll just make yourself crazy . 
vilyum ,  i am necdit yesil . 
jeremy .  .  . 
fine .   you want me to call your supervisor ? 
its muscles are locked . 
can we get this car there ? 
what do you -  ? 
he &apos;s special . 
what are you doing down here ? 
he &apos;s out there .  i heard him .  how can he be ?  this things .  .  . 
evolution doesn &apos;t work that fast .  something pushed that thing to take the leap .  we need to find another specimen . 
metaxonycha godmani . 
susan ,  listen to me :   you handled that insect almost as much as siri .  .  . 
his blood !  it &apos;s driving them crazy !  we have to mask the odor ! 
it worked before .  .  . 
you guys have done a nice job .   how bout five dollars ? 
siri ,  sandblast that thing .  it looks like trump tower .   those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions .  .  . 
watch your step ,  siri .   your grant could be on the line here . 
well .  .  .    .  .  . maybe it takes time to get the hang of it . 
thanks ,  miz wilkes ,  but i don &apos;t want to take up any more of your time .  i best be going . 
you &apos;ve been here two days .  you &apos;re gonna be okay .   my name is annie wilkes and i &apos;m -  - 
don &apos;t move now -  - wouldn &apos;t want to hurt this neck -  -   well ,  the other afternoon i was on my way home ,  and there you were ,  leaving the lodge ,  and i wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming . 
when do you think the phone lines &apos;ll be back up ?  i have to call my daughter ,  and i should call new york and let my agent know i &apos;m breathing . 
i don &apos;t want her spirit !  i want her !  and you murdered her ! 
what are you doing on the floor ?   it &apos;s my fault .  if i &apos;d had a proper hospital bed ,  this never would have happened .  here ,  let me help you back in .   i know this hurts ,  but it &apos;ll only take a few seconds .  there you go .  comfy ? 
i know this is the only copy ,  paul .  when you were twenty - four you wrote your first book and you didn &apos;t make a copy ,  because you didn &apos;t think anybody would take it seriously .  but they did .  and ever since you &apos;ve never made any copies because you &apos;re superstitious -  - it &apos;s why you always come back to the silver creek lodge .  you told that story to merv griffin eleven years ago . 
yes .  it will be a book in my honor .  for saving your life and nursing you back to health .  i &apos;ll be the first one to read it .   oh ,  paul ,  you &apos;re going to make me the envy of the whole world .  .  . 
i expect nothing less than your masterpiece . 
you -  - fooler .  .  .  !   did i do good ? 
i &apos;m sorry ,  paul .  this is all wrong ,  you &apos;ll have to do it over again . 
that &apos;s right -  - when i was growing up in bakersfield ,  my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on saturday afternoons for the chapter plays .  .  . 
don &apos;t be silly .  of course you can . 
you can -  - you have the  &quot; gotta &quot;  -  - 
the  &quot; gotta .  &quot;  remember ,  you talked about it in playboy magazine .  you said there &apos;s a million things you can &apos;t do in this world; you can &apos;t hit a curve ball ,  you can &apos;t fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work -  -  but there &apos;s one thing you always have ,  and that &apos;s the power of the  &quot; gotta .  &quot; 
to misery . 
paul ,  this is positively the best misery you &apos;ve ever written . 
annie ,  what is it ? 
you &apos;ve been out of your room . 
paul ,  my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south . 
did i do good ? 
virginia ,  when you &apos;re in this car ,  you &apos;re not my wife ,  you &apos;re my deputy . 
stop -  - stop right here . 
could be the weight of the snow . 
here &apos;s the list of all sheldon &apos;s credit charges .  nothing after the silver creek .   any calls ? 
virginia ,  i &apos;m flattered you think i got that much energy .  i just figured if i can &apos;t find paul sheldon ,  at least i can find out what he wrote about . 
 &quot; there is a justice higher than that of man .  i will be judged by him .  &quot; 
they &apos;re hauling misery into court . 
just leave it ,  all right ? 
that thing .   here it is .  right where it &apos;s supposed to be . 
i &apos;m a literary agent ,  and i feel like a fool calling you ,  but i think one of my clients ,  paul sheldon ,  might be in some kind of trouble . 
no ,  no ,  of course not .  it &apos;s just that his daughter hasn &apos;t heard from him ,  and when he &apos;s got a book coming out ,  he usually keeps in touch .  so when there was no word from him .  .  . 
i don &apos;t think mr .  sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary .  considering who he is and all ,  famous and all ,  he doesn &apos;t have airs .  drives the same car out from new york each time -  -  &apos;65 mustang -  - said it helps him think .  he was always a good guest ,  never made a noise ,  never bothered a soul .  sure hope nothing happened to him . 
gee ,  marcia ,  if i didn &apos;t know you better ,  i &apos;d think you were suggesting i dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks . 
i thought you were over it . 
i said you &apos;re beautiful ,  nyah . 
you won . 
see anything you like ? 
sort it all out . 
a change of plans ? 
oh ,  no ,  not at all .   maybe just a bit . 
feel like pleading for your life ? 
god damn it ,  nyah !   why did you do it ?   why did you save that bastard ? 
what are you talking about ? 
outrageous .   i won &apos;t let you take control of my company . 
i would &apos;ve thought the hardest part was exercising restraint .   curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off .   you were in such a hurry to knock off that 747 ,  you never figured out where the virus really was . 
billy .   i think we got a problem .   nyah &apos;s on the wing .   up early .   billy ,  do you copy ? 
say again .  sounds like you &apos;re saying  &apos;she &apos;s in the building .  &apos;
she &apos;s in the elevator heading toward ethan . 
what can we do &apos; mate ? 
would you mind if i &apos;m on top ? 
 -  right .  . where is it ? 
i &apos;m missing something here ,  aside from a 500 , 000 pound necklace .   even after i botched the job ,  i could &apos;ve walked out of there with the bloody thing . 
if you weren &apos;t going to let me get away with it ,  why did you let me go thru with it ? 
i need your help and i thin you can use mine . 
scotland yard ,  interpol ,  every dutch authority .   i can make them go away . 
ask a question ,  you get an answer !  .  . 
there &apos;s nearly 2 million in london . 
go and insinuate yourself back into sean &apos;s life . 
but i don &apos;t have a conscience .   i &apos;m a bloody thief . 
well ,  i mean it &apos;s not a total loss .   it is keeping a very capable thief off the street .  . 
have you met them ? 
where do i meet you ? 
nyah ,  you &apos;ve done more than enough .   even the best of snake charmers get bit . 
what did you think you were doing ! 
in order to do that ,  i &apos;ve got to figure out how he plans to make money with it . 
you made it sound as if i was recruiting her for her skills as a thief . 
she &apos;s got no training for this kind of thing . 
something else ? 
of course it was .   anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do ,  is bound to get a little flak here and there .   you try flogging the stories on cnn i &apos;ve had to come up with about what &apos;s been going on around here the last few days .   at any rate ,  it &apos;s been most instructive  -  -  what they &apos;ll swallow ,  or what they &apos;ll broadcast with a straight face .   miss hall &apos;s blood ,  it appears ,  has absolutely no elements of the chimera virus .   not even antibodies . 
and that appears to have been destroyed .  it also contained the anti - virus ,  bellerophon . 
it &apos;s the transponder . 
roger that . 
thirty - second opening in the roof and a 250 - foot drop . 
so what did he say ? 
a visit from an old friend . 
oh ,  please !   how was i to know they had to be treated with bellerophon within twenty hours ? 
you still don &apos;t get it ,  do you ?   you want to make an omelet ,  you break a few eggs  -  i needed to know just how bad the disease was< / i>  -  in the real world ,  not the lab .   and you never know til you try .   you thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas .   but i saw you creating a disease so terrible in chimera< / i> that the cure would be priceless . 
you asked for my help .   you asked< / u> for my< / u> help .  .  . come on .  .  . 
come on ! 
what can we do ,  barnes ?   put a guy at the airport ?   how many identities do you think hunt has ?   how many times has he slipped past custom ,  in how many countries ?   these guys are trained to be ghosts .   we< / u> taught them how to do it ,  for christ &apos;s sake ! 
dont jim . 
i want to sleep .   can i sleep here . 
i &apos;m walking . 
what ? 
that was four hours ago !   who sent you ?  did they send you here ? 
jim was my husband .  i want to know who killed him .   i want to get the son of a bitch who did this . 
okay .  .  . 
claire .  .  . hey .  .  . 
this is kittridge . 
passport ,  visas  -  you know the drill .  we &apos;ll work the exfiltration thru canada ,  debrief you at langley .   throw the prague police a bone ,  you know toss them a few suspects .   follow me ? 
we &apos;ve lost enough agents for one night . 
what ? 
what kind ? 
it &apos;s all one big negotiation ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
he was a good guy for a long ,  long time .  just  -  not long enough .   gotta catch my flight .  .  so .   how &apos;s it feel being a solid citizen again ? 
who are you and what are you doing here ? 
how will you make sure job will be there ? 
the possibility alone is worth ten million .   baggage car ,  rack 3 .   silver briefcase .   combination 314 . 
what sector &apos;s the air conditioning ? 
simple game .   four players .   exfil opens the pocket  -  -    -  -  cyber ops lifts the wallet . 
imf mainframe . 
you &apos;re not going to any meeting without me . 
sarah eye on the package .   jim ,  im coming to you . 
i &apos;m willing to take the chance . 
abort .   thats an order . 
 -  so i watched europe .  once you showed up in england .  . it was easy . 
kitteridge .   oh my god !   kittridge is the mole ? 
jim .  .  .  ? 
 -  no .   she cant know about me .   no one can .   not til this is over .   theres too much at stake ,  ethan . 
arent you going to thank me jim .   ten million is better than six . 
sorry ethan .   times up .   say goodbye . 
jim ,  its over . 
that &apos;s what we do isn &apos;t it ? 
try it again . 
its working . 
very good ,  mr .  johnny . 
uh - huh
i don &apos;t like him . 
i have no money ! 
where you been ? 
i just want you to know .  no matter what you do .  you are going to die ,  just like everybody else . 
i have my eyes open . 
you &apos;re not sleepy ? 
i &apos;m getting married . 
he &apos;s flying to sicily .  his mother &apos;s dying . 
yeah . 
you haven &apos;t once said you like my dress . 
it &apos;s wrong to just let them go . 
i won &apos;t have to shoot those dogs .  they will kill each other . 
it &apos;s wood .  it &apos;s fake .  five years ago i was engaged to be married .  johnny came in here ,  he ordered bread from me .  i put it in the slicer and i talked with him and my hand got caught cause i wasn &apos;t paying attention .  the slicer chewed off my hand .  it &apos;s funny  &apos;cause  -  when my fianc saw that i was maimed ,  she left me for another man . 
that &apos;s it . 
you don &apos;t have to help me . 
fast . 
how many men since then ? 
why you talking to me ? 
to the bed . 
what about johnny ? 
what ? 
you &apos;re invited to the wedding !  it &apos;s in a few weeks .  why didn &apos;t you do like him and be with your dying mother in palermo ? 
last night never happened ,  you hear me ?  i &apos;m gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened ,  and you and i are gonna take this to our coffins ! 
but that &apos;s cause he don &apos;t know ! 
no thanks . 
what do you want to do now ? 
what &apos;s the matter ? 
you &apos;re making me feel guilty again . 
this is your place . 
this is where we &apos;re going ! 
loretta ? 
will you marry me ,  loretta castorini clark ? 
you never have dessert . 
will you marry me ? 
will you marry me ? 
we got married at the city hall and i think it gave bad luck the whole marriage . 
he &apos;s my younger brother . 
ssh ,  it &apos;s me .  i &apos;m calling from the deathbed of my mother . 
what ? 
grandma was still alive .  chiro was still home going to school .  now he &apos;s married and gone to florida .  if you and johnny moved in ,  had a baby .  .  . 
how &apos;s the mother ? 
did he tell her ? 
what ?  he &apos;s in sicily ! 
what !  !  she was dying ! 
hi . 
no . 
i know . 
alright . 
he owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none . 
talk to him . 
moving in ? 
so . 
who was that ? 
i &apos;m sure she did . 
do you have a girlfriend ? 
when i was twenty - seven years old ,  in jersey city ,  i asked a woman to marry me .  she had red hair .  she smelled a jasmine .  she wore black shoes with pointy white tips . 
my lady friend has a personality disorder . 
then i &apos;d be delighted .  i hate eating alone ,  and it &apos;s amazing how often i end up doing just that . 
i &apos;m a professor .  i teach communications at n . y . u . 
sheila ?  yes she was .  is .  was . 
i &apos;ll remember that .  what do you do ? 
yes . 
he &apos;s a plumber . 
look . 
it &apos;s cosmo &apos;s moon . 
i don &apos;t know . 
you got me . 
burn her anyway . 
halt !   who goes there ? 
get away ! 
you &apos;ve got two empty halves of coconuts and you &apos;re banging them together . 
king of the who ? 
a what ? 
we shall do no such thing  .  .  .  let us pass ! 
what ,   &quot; is &quot;  ? 
none shall pass . 
look ! 
come here . 
i &apos;m invincible ! 
all right ,  we &apos;ll call it a draw . 
hello . 
i am king arthur and these are the knights of the round table .   whose castle is this ? 
are you sure he &apos;s got one ? 
well  .  .  .  can we come up and have a look ? 
and that ,  my lord ,  is how we know the earth to be banana - shaped . 
they &apos;re nervous ,  sire . 
who are they ? 
look ,  you &apos;re a busy man  .  .  . 
you didn &apos;t bother to find out ,  did you ? 
 .  .  .  but a two - thirds majority  .  .  . 
come and see the violence inherent in the system .  help ,  help ,  i &apos;m being repressed ! 
oh ,  did you hear that !   what a give - away . 
 .  .  .  um  .  .  .  yes  .  .  .  no  .  .  .  a bit  .  .  .  yes .  .  .  she has got a wart . 
make a bridge out of her . 
what is your quest ? 
ask me the questions ,  bridgekeeper .   i am not afraid . 
my name is sir robin of camelot ! 
bring out your dead ! 
i can &apos;t . 
thanks very much . 
well taken ,  concorde ! 
gosh  -  is he all right ? 
but ,  father . 
who are you ? 
hurry ,  brave sir launcelot ! 
oh ,  yes !   we &apos;ll keep him in here ,  obviously .   but if he had to leave and we were with him . 
make sure he doesn &apos;t leave . 
yes  .  .  .   make sure  .  .  . 
well  .  .  . 
no look ,  really ,  this isn &apos;t nescess  .  .  . 
well  .  .  .  yes  .  .  .  but i hadn &apos;t realised  .  .  . 
when you have found the shrubbery ,  place the shrubbery here ,  beside this shrubbery  .  .  .  only slightly higher ,  so you get a two - level effect with a path through the middle . 
er ,  that &apos;s  .  .  .  that &apos;s enough music for a while ,  lads .  it looks as though like there &apos;s dirty work afoot . 
which one of us is she flirting with ? 
it &apos;s what the maids are for . 
have i seen you up in balmoral ,  mary ? 
checked and locked ,  sir . 
good .   she &apos;s a good girl .   aren &apos;t you ?  yeah ,  she &apos;s a lovely girl .   and you know the queen &apos;s riding tomorrow ? 
i fear the influence he has on her .  the man &apos;s word is not to be credited .  he is an arriviste of the very lowest water .   she &apos;s having a bust cast of him .   in nero marquino marble . 
i wish to see my mother . 
mother .  .  .  . 
surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop .  .  . 
mama .  .  . 
checked and locked ,  sir . 
i didn &apos;t come all this way to sit on my arse . 
no . 
that can wait till the weekend . 
if i find out that you had anything to do with this ,  i will have you sacked . 
this is a slur on her good name . 
nobody has any rights over me . 
what do you know about the highlands ? 
do you hunt ? 
still ,  someone must attend you .   your wife should not have let you out . 
oh . 
they don &apos;t see it . 
you are well ? 
then why do you persist in doing it ? 
prince albert was going to build a bench here .   he thought it one of the best views in osborne . 
it is a fine spot for a bench ,  is it not ? 
those ,  over there ,  there . 
we took a nip of whiskey . 
must they always follow us ? 
am i not safe enough with you ,  john ? 
i had foreseen that you would not .  but your majesty should understand  -  -  that my mind will not be changed in this .   i leave for deeside  -  - 
then they may read about me . 
surely ,  you &apos;re not suggesting we dispense -  - 
what did he want ? 
what &apos;s her excuse this time ? 
a distinct flushing around the cheeks .  she was drunk ,  i tell you . 
forgive me ,  your majesty .   in no way did i wish to suggest -  - 
how long has he been this sick ? 
he thought ,  perhaps ,  your majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government . 
read it . 
why not ? 
no - one should think themselves wiser than me !   it is not for any of the queen &apos;s subjects to presume to tell her majesty when and where she should come out of mourning .   it is the queen &apos;s sorrow that keeps her secluded !   it is her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility ,  work which she feels will soon wear her out entirely ! 
then why are you not with him ? 
how the hell did you do that ? 
maybe he &apos;s not dead . 
the donor .   maybe he &apos;s alive inside the game . 
now what seems to be the problem ? 
if this is a joke ,  i &apos;m not laughing . 
so take his car home .   wait .   i &apos;m sure he &apos;s up to something .  .  . 
hello ? 
alex ,  you don &apos;t know how long i &apos;ve waited for this . 
happy ? 
this is like a movie or something .   i mean ,  am i paranoid or what ? 
the police ,  then .  .  . 
slip - stream . 
you &apos;re not coming ,  alex . 
thanks .   always wanted to do that . 
and we &apos;ve still got time left .   this was a piece of cake . 
our time &apos;s up . 
we can &apos;t reach that ! 
so how did you do it ,  alex ? 
is .  .  . is that where we are ?   did i die ? 
so what do you think ? 
so start at the beginning .  .  . 
but i &apos;m not broke . 
yeah ,  the cowboy .  this guy ,  the cowboy ,  wants to see you .  jason said he thought it would be a good idea . 
it &apos;s been a very strange day . 
cynthia .  .  .  that would not be a good idea . 
i understand ,  cynthia and thank you for the offer .  i &apos;ll find a place .  now go ahead and give the cowboy a yodel and get back to me . 
beautiful night . 
yes .  .  . what is it ? 
i can call them .  .  .  i can call my dad . 
no  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . i . 
no .  .  . i need to sleep . 
what is it rita ?

zach ,  how old are you ,  son  ? 
and how much do we pay you annually  ? 
thank you ,  sir .  i was really hoping for shares ,  or possibly cash .  .  .  but this ,  this is really personal . 
that was rather .  .  .  .  disappointing . 
what if we were to put bruce into the park as a guest  ? 
sir  ?  we &apos;re moving them right along as fast as we can . 
have you ever considered running your own  &quot; park &quot;   ?  i mean ,  since you will not be returning to your former profession . 
bruce has just awaken . 
what &apos;s next  ? 
thank you very much . 
the power went out in half the park . 
listen ,  i was thinking ,  you know .  would you go ,  it &apos;s i think you &apos;re .  .  . 
it &apos;s sounds so much better when you say it .  i &apos;m semi traditional here ,  and it &apos;s important that i ask .  will you go out with me  ? 
i just want to have something that &apos;s mine ,  you know  ?  it &apos;s like living off of their money is fun and all .  there are certain materialistic needs that i have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch . 
sweet jesus i never dreamed i &apos;d be glad to see central park at night . 
thanks a lot .  i always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight . 
excuse me i asked you a question . 
thank you . 
wow ,  you walked out with my mother ? 
you want me to move ? 
don &apos;t do that ,  you &apos;ve got the whole garage . 
dad i &apos;m kidding ,  you can have the room . 
seriously . 
dad ,  when a boy likes you ,  does he pretend that he doesn &apos;t like you ?  and if he pretends that he doesn &apos;t like you how can you tell that he likes you ? 
she was talented ,  but honey i wish i could help you a little more ,  it &apos;s just that your mother and i had kind of a whirlwind courtship ,  she came to town with this traveling theater group ,  i proposed on our second date ,  two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone . 
what does that mean ? 
hello ?  sultenfuss parlor . 
his name &apos;s harry sultenfuss . 
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re here . 
i don &apos;t know very much about her .  .  . i was hoping that you could help me . 
do you have any pictures if her ? 
it &apos;s good to see maggie again .  .  . and you . 
well i didn &apos;t know about you until after she was gone . 
maggie wanted to have a baby .  .  . and .  .  . umm .  .  . i didn &apos;t . 
my mother can &apos;t have any more kids .

i don &apos;t think anybody should change their names ,  that way you can always find them when you need them . 
just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot; .

how about nick ?  did he take good care of you ? 
committed ? 
do you think i should tell my dad about jeffrey pommeroy ? 
well ,  i &apos;ve come this far .  .  . the least i can do is knock on the door . 
he was caressing . 
god ?  no i didn &apos;t think you &apos;d want to invoke god rose ,  because he saw even more than i did .  rose look phil ,  if you want the rights of a husband ,  you &apos;re gonna have to ask me something but if not ,  you &apos;re gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are .

i &apos;m just tired . 
oh ,  are you a hairdresser ? 
oh no ,  i ,  i .  .  . eh .  .  . i couldn &apos;t . 
i know ,  i guess it &apos;s just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life .  it &apos;s not easy being a woman . 
is that why uncle phil moved there ? 
really ? 
i would have tried to show her a good time .  i promised her when she left that i would never forget her and i never did .  stanley rosenfeld does not forget .

i &apos;m not joking .   i had to face up to all my competitive drives ,  and believe me ,  i &apos;ve got  &apos;em .

wallace egregious residence ,  mandy speaking . 
under the circumstances .   charmed to know you ,  jules . 
i thought michael was picking me up .

it &apos;s weird being the groom .   all these things kimmy has to take care of .  .  . 
wow and wow .   you have a date ,  after this ?

well ,  the school will be here .  architecture will still be around .  right now .  .  . 
it would only be ,  maybe ,  six months ?  or three or four ?  it would mean so much to him .  .  .

if you &apos;re serious .  being serious is real important . 
don &apos;t you think they &apos;d just love another song instead ? 
what was the color of tim &apos;s belt ? 
that means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife .  am i correct on that point ? 
which do you recommend ? 
mallory ,  what did you think of mickey &apos;s plan ?  did you think it would work ? 
hasn &apos;t it ? 
why are mickey and mallory being moved to an asylum ?  and who made the decision ? 
i take it by your answer it was a whole new team ? 
so can we .  so the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy .  and we &apos;re shippin &apos;  &apos;em to nystrom asylum for the criminally insane . 
you &apos;re a breathing icon of justice and that &apos;s why you were chosen to deliver mr .  and mrs .  knox .  we ,  the prison board we ,  knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen ,  an escape attempt ,  an accident ,  fire ,  anything .  .  . jack  &apos;supercop &apos; scagnetti would be there to look out for his public &apos;s best interests . 
who &apos;s the song bird ? 
 .  .  . one night i was asleep ,  and a noise wakes me up .  i thought ,   &apos;oh shit ,  somebody &apos;s broken in .  &apos; i didn &apos;t own a gun ,  so i go into the living room with a fucking umbrella .  okay ,  it turned out to be nothing .  god made the noise .  who knows ? 
okay ,  buddy boy ,  where ya keepin &apos; mallory ?  i know she &apos;s still here ,  and i know you know where .  so ,  start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene . 
do you have a back up . 
yes .  yours got the larger nielson share . 
she won &apos;t even see me ,  mickey .  now you &apos;re not supposed to know anything about what &apos;s going on with her ,  but i &apos;m gonna tell ya somethin &apos; .  since you two &apos;ve been sentenced ,  mallory hasn &apos;t spoken one word . 
i could go for a coke . 
we ain &apos;t got all fuckin &apos; day ! 
just wait one fucking minute . 
 .  .  . developed between the three of us .  we &apos;re kindda in this together ,  don &apos;t ya think ? 
let &apos;s make a little music ,  colorada . 
i can &apos;t run with you ,  mickey !  i really want to .  if i could ,  i would ,  but i can &apos;t .  i gotta stay here .  but you can still get out of here . 
i admire them . 
hypnotizing . 
 -  -  - and a snake - eye glare ,  arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence ferigno had . 
only on a much grander scale . 
that &apos;s the mickey and mallory way . 
they had us tied down during one of their house raids ,  you &apos;ve seen the headlines ,  and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us . 
so ,  mallory calls 911 and they took off . 
i want two men stationed in that tier ,  and i want men with rifles all along the walkway . 
take a wild stab ! 
the entire wing ? 
drink up !  this is a celebration .  this is the day we received word we were gonna make television history .  we &apos;re gonna have the first sit down ,  in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever ,  one day before he &apos;s being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life .  this is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist &apos;s career .  this is wallace with noriega ,  this is elton john confessing his bi - sexuality to the rolling stone ,  this is the tearful reporting of the hindenberg disaster ,  this is truffaut setting the record straight on hitchcock ,  this is a robert capa photo ,  this is woodward and bernstien meeting deep throat in an underground parking lot ,  this is john reid reporting  &apos;the ten days that shook the world &apos; ,  this is the hippies &apos; bloody palms at kent state ,  the maysles brothers at altamont ,  this is the nixon / frost interviews .  .  . 
how immediate is immediately ? 
now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode .  but we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope . 
who ? 
yeah ,  we met .  they &apos;re good men .

you &apos;ll be in trouble ,  son .   now just how do you intend to support your family ? 
oh yeah ?   seems to me ,  reverend ,  you &apos; more concerned  &apos;bout your good .  guess it looks kind  &apos;a bad ,  havin &apos; me for a son - in - law .

alright .  let &apos;s talk business . 
your gun ,  your prints .  the tessiers might overlook a little child molesting ,  but murder &apos;s bad p . r .  ,  mr .  riviera .  i suggest to reconsider my offer . 
are you sure you &apos;re up to this ,  mr .  case ?  we could reconvene tomorrow . 
if someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe .  i &apos;m assembling a team of specialists ,  mr .  case .  we need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur . 
what would you say if i told you we could correct your neural damage ?

really ?  .  .  . 
and this is the thanks i get .   i did you a favor .   you never wanted to marry that joker in the first place .

i bet dolores told charlie . 
okay .  but let &apos;s have a girls night soon .  maybe a pajama party . 
charlie really has a great voice . 
we &apos;re here on the sofa bed .  .  . 
come on peggy .  say what we rehearsed . 
you don &apos;t want them ?  they &apos;re going to make a big comeback any minute .  mark my words ,  these lamps are going to .  .  . 
not now ,  charlie .  i &apos;ve got a headache .  get used to the word .  roll it around your tongue for a years . 
you know .  about what we said on tuesday .  it makes a lot of sense . 
want me to drive you home later ? 
i noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch .  i guess i deserved it .  i &apos;ve been thinking about my three year plan and i think it &apos;s unworkable .  i must have been delirious . 
yeah .  like that . 
right .  i promised my mother . 
charlie ,  what do you think of richard norvik ? 
there isn &apos;t a girl in school that can hold a candle to you .  . 
you really love me ,  don &apos;t you ? 
i probably meant it when i said it .   doesn &apos;t lucky chuckie want to come out ? 
i will be happy if i have you .  i love you . 
what are you talking about ?  who &apos;s janet ? 
well ,  how about a walk ,  charlie bell .  . 
just take a look at it .  
let me got !  where are you taking me ? 
hello ,  charlie . 
god ,  peggy ,  you &apos;re so unformed you &apos;re practically fetal .  you &apos;re just taking pity on him  &apos;cause he has no friends . 
i beg your pardon ? 
hey terry ,  what is that ?   did peggy make it up ?   i &apos;ve never seen that on bandstand . 
it was my idea ,  grandma .  i always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings . 
it was beth &apos;s idea . 
beth &apos;s boyfriend is playing in the band . 
don &apos;t get your hopes up . 
the world is fantastic .  it &apos;s the ultimate absurd circus .  i am shot from a cannon into the energy . 
the only thing my father digs is cold ,  green money .  all my mother cares about is her standing at the country club . 
no ,  i just made that up .  do you want to hear one ? 
that was quite an evening .  bourgeois ,  phony ,  decadent ,  stupid . 
now listen ,  this is the plan .  as soon as school is finished we go to utah and .  .  . 
dad ,  i never knew you had a sense of humor . 
peggy ,  let me ask you something .   you &apos;re not .  .  .  expecting are you ? 
yes but i was a boy .  and i still had hell to pay . 
do you know how ridiculous you sound ?  first of all ,  it &apos;s illegal for u . s .  citizens to buy gold .  and in the second place ,  the price of gold is regulated by the government . 
quiet today ? 
the hat business is in trouble . 
but when john f .  kennedy &apos;s elected president ,  men &apos;1l stop wearing hats . 
jack ,  take it easy .  she gave blood at school today .  maybe she &apos;s just a little lightheaded . 
who was that man ? 
what happened to you ? 
that &apos;s a good girl .  .  .  i hate to see you so upset .   tell me ,  sweetheart .  are you having problems with charlie ?  you mentioned something this morning . 
charlie &apos;s downstairs .  why aren &apos;t you ready ? 
you know ,  dear ,  i think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea ,  but the next time you come up with something ,  please don &apos;t stay out all night .  just tell us .  we &apos;ll believe you . 
sheerotards .  catchy name ,  isn &apos;t it ?  like leotards . 
what &apos;s up ? 
you look exactly the same . 
he &apos;s not here .  we &apos;re getting divorced . 
i have to talk to you .  it &apos;s very important . 
it &apos;s not that .  can we meet after school ?  please ? 
okay .  i promise . 
what &apos;re you doing ? 
okay ,  you &apos;re not dead ,  but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible . 
you &apos;re a molecule in chaos ,  a discontinuent aberration .  maybe you &apos;ve just got powers of precognition .  well ,  maybe you &apos;re just out of whack . 
i &apos;m talking about invention ,  no investment .  i know what people think of me .  mr .  spasmatician .  dick the square root .  i &apos;ll show them .  you said i was going to be a millionaire .  and you &apos;re gonna help ! 
richard !  they don &apos;t have any !  they never heard of them !  isn &apos;t that wonderful ? 
jogging .  i was running ,  now i &apos;m jogging . 
like what ? 
look ,  i &apos;m desperate .  i &apos;ll try anything .  but what if you can &apos;t snap me out of it ? 
what will they be made of ? 
no !  yes !  i &apos;ll be right out ,  dad .   oh shit !  peggy ,  i &apos;m going to snap you out of it . 
vision ?  i &apos;m a walking anachronism !  i &apos;ve upset my parents .  i miss my kids .  i could be trapped here forever !  and poor charlie .  .  . i got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married .  tomorrow &apos;s my birthday !  i &apos;ve got to get out of here now . 
what ? 
i &apos;m real excited about working for you mr .  matthews .  .  . 
what &apos;s wrong ?  ! 
you nervous ?  new town ,  new school .  i know it must be pretty hard for you .  .  . 
who was that ? 
geoff ,  dinner &apos;s ready !   geoff ?  ! 
zowie .  .  . 
you want me to help ? 
how can he not have a heartbeat ? 
it &apos;s weird .  .  . 
mom .  .  . 
jesus . 
what in god &apos;s name .  .  .   ? 
this time .  what about next time ? 
it could be parasites ,  an infection .  .  . 
why are you getting dressed ? 
you &apos;re leaving the hospital ?  you &apos;re going into the office looking like that ?  are you insane ? 
you got that right ,  mikey .  .  .   you still believe that ,  don &apos;t you ? 
what &apos;s that mean ?  ! 
i know that ,  charles . 
 .  .  .  meanwhile ,  i &apos;d like to prepare you for a colonoscopy ,  so we can take a look inside . 
kids are great . 
i was diagnosed with aids eight months ago .  during a bout of pneumonia .  i recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days .  since i was doing so well on the azt ,  we decided against telling anyone about it . 
hell ,  they are staring .  what &apos;s that shit on your face ? 
so kenton connected the .  .  .  lesion ,  and< / u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life .  .  .  to this woman ,  maria .  .  .  and blew the whistle on you .  suddenly you &apos;re losing files ,  and it &apos;s time to let you go .  but ,  up to this point ,  you &apos;ve been their golden boy ,  their rising star .  .  .  their behavior is .  .  .  inconsistent . 
beckett ? 
then we establish how wheeler &apos;s boys recruited you after law school .  .  . 
i &apos;ve considered that . 
i know a good probate lawyer . 
a regular all - american guy ? 
i thought i was supposed to be covering for you .   god ,  andy ,  you look awful . 
what can i do ? 
when ?  approximately what year did this event take place ? 
but you were< / u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985 ? 
while you were employed at wyant wheeler ,  you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual ,  correct ? 
some do .  i didn &apos;t . 
miguel has not been infected .  as i said ,  we weren &apos;t aware of aids ,  then ,  or how it is spread . 
and it &apos;s your contention ,  that when the partners were made aware of the lesions ,  they jumped to the conclusion you had aids and fired you . 
by the time i was fired ,  there were four lesions on my face ,  much bigger .  .  . 
hello ? 
ms .  burton .  you &apos;re black . 
and ,  when lawyers break the law ,  when this society loses respect for the law ,  when that day comes ,  our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground ,  and our children and grandchildren will live like savages . 
we object ,  your honor .  it would unfairly influence the jury . 
the hiv virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids ,  namely blood and semen . 
were you pleased with his work ? 
mr .  laird ,  when i approached you about being a witness at this trial ,  and you agreed ,  you gave sworn testimony in a deposition .  is that correct ? 
it &apos;s a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied .  a cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming .  do you agree ? 
let &apos;s put it this way ,  andy :  your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure . 
and i hate to rush you out of here ,  but .  .  . 
sometimes it seems like society is run< / u> by these kinds of people . 
whoa ,  whoa ,  whoa ,  whoa .  .  .  do you think .  .  .   ?  you think i &apos;m< / u> .  .  .    .  .  .  gay ? 
what &apos;s the matter with you ?  do i look gay to you ? 
you &apos;re the asshole ,  buddy . 
you load the film .  .  .   ?  no ,  on this side .  .  .  or this side ?  don &apos;t move the baby ! 
don &apos;t know ,  joe . 
i &apos;ll see you in an hour ,  max . 
yeah .  but we took care of him . 
i know< / u> the difference .  that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m always able to recognize the difference . 
if it please your honor ,  we hope< / u> to settle this matter . 
reinstatement at full salary .  back pay covering the period of unemployment and .  .  . 
andy .  it seems that something has come over you ,  lately :  a kind of .  .  .  stupor ,  a fogginess ,  a lack of focus .  .  .  earth to andy .  anybody home ? 
he was doing a great job . 
gonna lose everybody out here .  .  .  . 
oh ,  lord .  .  .  . 
tell me about the sounds .  you told them you heard something right before .  .  .  .   if you don &apos;t talk to me ,  johns &apos;ll take another crack at it  -  -  at your skull . 
heard about it .  just never seen it . 
what about her ? 
how many you see ? 
 &apos;course i am  -  -  but doesn &apos;t mean i won &apos;t leave you here .  if you believe anything about me ,  better be that . 
i hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact ,  but that sand - cat won &apos;t run at night . 
amazing .  i &apos;m johns . 
and him ? 
s &apos;matter ? 
a very good sign .   that &apos;s riddick &apos;s direction .  you do not< / u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy . 
so now you know . 
i know< / u> what happened  -  -  he went off on the guy ,  buried him on the hill somewhere ,  and now he &apos;s trying to  -  - 
well ,  don &apos;t ask me to . 
owens was already dead .  his brain just hadn &apos;t caught on to that fact . 
stop it ,  stop it ,  stop it ! 
smoke screen for what ? 
we aren &apos;t completely stupid . 
hey ,  you &apos;re< / u> the one who got me out here ,  turned me into a goddamn sled dog .  an &apos; now you  &apos;spect me to go back like a whipped< / u> dog ? 
i mean ,  i mean ,  chrono shows we &apos;re 22 weeks out ,  so gravity wasn &apos;t supposed to kick in for another 19 .  i mean ,  i mean ,  i mean ,  why did i fall at all< / u> ? 
1550 millibars ,  dropping 20 mb per minute ,  shit ,  we &apos;re hemorrhaging air .  somethin &apos;< / u> took a swipe at us . 
fry ? 
look ,  fry .  company says we &apos;re responsible for every one of those  -  - 
i saw the cut - marks on the bones .  wasn &apos;t a natural die - off . 
oh ,  no .  no ,  no ,  no .  .  .  . 
has anyone seen the young one ?  ali ? 
king tut &apos;s tomb .  .  .  . 
what the hell are these ? 
very big beads . 
found somethin &apos; worse than me ,  huh ? 
want you to remember this moment ,  riddick .  the way it coulda gone and didn &apos;t . 
about how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff .  goddamnit ,  we &apos;re just doin &apos; the heavy lifting for this prick ! 
look ,  it &apos;s hellified stuff  -  -  but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies .  it &apos;s called  &quot; triage ,  &quot;  okay ? 
what &apos;s her name ,  anyway ? 
so much for your nightfall . 
amazing how you can do without the essentials of life  -  -  so long as you have the luxuries . 
you were tryin &apos; to kill him too . 
dr .  zaius  -  - 
how did you know we &apos;d come here ? 
seal the cave ? 
nothing much .  the remnants of a life raft .  maybe a small flag .  the emblem of my countrymen . 
you &apos;ve never told me why this region &apos;s called the forbidden zone . 
taylor ,  i &apos;d rather you  - 
that &apos;s bright eyes .  the one i was telling you about . 
 &apos;then how do you account for me ?  , 
cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis  - 
a toy .  it floats on the air .   try it . 
how did it go ? 
one pistol .  .  .  twenty - four rounds of ammo .  two medical kits .  .  one camera .  .  .  one tx9 .   we &apos;ve enough food and water for three days . 
where there &apos;s one there &apos;s another .  and another .  and another . 
objection .  the accused is indeed a man .  therefore ,  he has no rights under ape law . 
he can reason ?  with the tribunal &apos;s permission ,  let me expose this hoax by direct examination . 
ridiculous .  that answer is a contradiction in terms .  tell us ,  bright eyes ,  why do men have no souls ?  what is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain ? 
landon !  join the expedition . 
and the glory ,  don &apos;t forget that .  there &apos;s a life - sized bronze statue of you somewhere .  it &apos;s probably turned green by now ,  and nobody can read the name plate .  but never let it be said we forget our heroes . 
i want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner . 
dr .  zira  -  -  tell bright eyes to sit down . 
you destroyed his memory !  his mind !  his identity !  and ,  you want to do the same to me ! 
thats a lie ! 
sustained . 
what about me ? 
you lied .  where is your tribe ? 
you may well call it upside down ,  since you occupy its lowest level .  and deservedly .   the eastern desert has never been explored  -  -  because we &apos;ve always assumed that no life can exist there .   save yourself ,  taylor .  tell me  -  -  is there another jungle beyond the forbidden zone ? 
twelve hundred years ago . 
why ?  from the first ,  i &apos;ve terrified you ,  doctor .  and in spite of every sign that i &apos;m an intelligent being who means no harm ,  you continue to hate and fear me .  why ? 
we &apos;re back at the beginning .  i still don &apos;t know the why .  a planet where apes evolved from men .  a world turned wrong side up .  a puzzle with one piece missing . 
cornelius and i have been indicted for heresy .  unless we can prove our theories ,  we don &apos;t stand a chance of acquittal . 
are you going to take her with you ? 
secondly ,  if these  &apos;tools &apos; as you call them ,  are unidentified ,  why are they introduced as  &apos;evidence &apos; of anything ? 
sarge ? 
bob ,  i got elias &apos; r&r .  .  .  it &apos;s coming up in 3 days .  going to hawaii .  see patsy .   i never asked you for a break ,  i was hoping you .  .  .  you &apos;d send me in on the chopper with king .  .  .  what do you say chief ?  
hey bob ,  come on !  talk to me hunh ,  it &apos;s your friend red ,  i &apos;m only asking you for three days chief .  .  . 
you gonna wipe your ass dis time ? 
don babytalk him man .  cocksucker fell asleep .  they walked right up on us ,  he don do shit . 
whaddaya talking shit for man .  hey junior !  y &apos;ever smoke any shit ? 
say i can dig it .  smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y &apos;know ?   y &apos;hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so &apos;s we become  &apos;pacifists &apos; so &apos;s we don fight  where the hell &apos;s everybody ,  they &apos;se gettin high that &apos;s what  -  bunch of hopheads ,  they think they special .  .  . 
yeah but i still like a piece of pussy once in a while  -  ain &apos;t nothing like a piece of pussy cept maybe the indie 500 . 
y &apos;ever look at yoself in the mirror junior ,  youse uglier than a dick on a dog man .  
does he have a metal plate in his head ? 
come on man ! 
what you got there  -  beers ? 
 .  .  . you know that night we got hit .  .  .  i .  .  .  
you been smoking too much shit babe .  gotta control that .  takes a man down .  .  .  i remember when you first come out to the bush ,  you was straight as a .  .  . 
way out of anything ,  man .  just keep your pecker up ,  your powder dry ,  the worm will turn .  how many days you short ? 
whatcha doing in the underworld taylor ? 
well he ain &apos;t normal that &apos;s fo sure . 
you could tell me your name .  and where you &apos;re going . 
indefinitely ? 
nice room .  balcony and everything .  lovely view too . 
nobody gets invited to clark brandon &apos;s parties .  they just go . 
okay .  you win . 
i &apos;m afraid there &apos;s nothing more tonight ,  miss .  unless you charter a plane . 
they might think i was running away from something . 
it &apos;s open - house .  no crashing involved .  anybody in the hotel &apos;s welcome . 
thanks for the fresh air .  that felt good . 
we walked right passed him .  he &apos;s following us . 
quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby ? 
he &apos;s a fellow with a very hard knee ,  and he knows how to use it . 
if you meant it ,  you wouldn &apos;t show it to me ,  betty .   or am i supposed to deliver it to dear inspector killaine ? 
there &apos;s a lot of water between vancouver and the u . s . a .  this note is a suicide note .   after you &apos;re gone where would they look for you ?   why would they look for you ?  darkness ,  and open water ,  and a fast cabin cruiser .   and i have a pocket full of money .   and if i helped you ,  i &apos;d be committing a crime ,  or so they tell me . 
who &apos;d believe it but you ?   i took him out to sea and threw him in the water .   even if they find him ,  what connects him with me ? 
would i want to ? 
i think you mean that . 
your family coat of arms ,  mr .  killaine ? 
down below &apos;s stanley park .  on the other side of the trees ,  there &apos;s a beach .  you can see it .   steveston &apos;s over there .  coast guard station .   there &apos;s the yacht club ,  and beyond it ,  the docks .  the over on the other side of the inlet ,  there &apos;s grouse mountain .  it &apos;s about 4000 feet high .  there &apos;s a restaurant on top of it .  very nice restaurant .   i &apos;m sorry we couldn &apos;t have met in pleasanter circumstances ,  miss mayfield . 
that &apos;s my hard luck -  - i &apos;m man enough to tell you about it -  - and not be sorry . 
that &apos;s they &apos;re business .   can i drop you somewhere ? 
you do things the hard way ,  don &apos;t you ? 
i &apos;d like a few words with you ,  in private . 
bluff .  you &apos;ve waited too long . 
all right ,  let &apos;s see the buzzer . 
who told you my name ? 
the usual grind . 
how are you two getting along ? 
the only answer i have for you . 
it could have been an accident . 
how could mitchell ?   after that act he put on up here ,  is it likely she &apos;d let him in ? 
i wouldn &apos;t know .  just do it somewhere else .  there is such a thing as good manners . 
so much less refined than frizzling them in the chair . 
what are you doing here ? 
passkey ? 
i saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun .  you lied .  it was obvious . 
and don &apos;t get too logical ,  driscoll .  in police business it doesn &apos;t work .  i wish it did .   but it doesn &apos;t
send that ? 
catch me at the vancouver royal if it &apos;s important . 
the super &apos;s just given me the sweetest dressing down i &apos;ve ever had .   i &apos;m still reeling from it .  and believe me ,  i had it coming .  i apologize .   what you think is important -  - i think is important . 
you in charge here ? 
that &apos;s pretty risky business ,  inspector . 
you &apos;ve got a dead man on your hands .  you killed jim -  - even if it wasn &apos;t murder .   what are you going to do about it ? 
exactly .   now i &apos;m the killer .   and there &apos;s something i don &apos;t want you to know .   something that would destroy my comfortable life ,  rob me of my friends ,  my position . 
this is the shell .   what about the gun ? 
how did he know he &apos;d get the chance ?  he couldn &apos;t have arranged it . 
i never saw it before . 
other people always know so much more than we know -  - so much more than they &apos;re willing to tell us . 
i don &apos;t understand . 
yes ,  i think so .   here are two glazed manila envelopes .   one is the bag type .   the other one had the money in it .   don &apos;t ask me how i know .   i know . 
no . 
it won &apos;t look pretty good on your record ,  killaine .   where &apos;s the girl now ? 
you &apos;re a young man .   you &apos;re romantic .   you think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together .  you think a soft voice means a soft heart .   you &apos;ll grow out of that . 
get out of here ! 
her name &apos;s mayfield .  betty mayfield . 
she &apos;s just a girl i met on the train .  you don &apos;t mind do you ? 
i &apos;ve always been a heel .  i guess i always will be . 
i seem to remember that you like to help yourself . 
what &apos;s this ? 
i didn &apos;t mean it that way  i &apos;m sorry . 
be nasty . 
my first husband worked for the bbc .   i doubt if anyone there remembers him now ,  just another long dead diligent administrator .  he would have been useful in the fight to preserve the bbc &apos;s independence during the suez crisis  -  one of the few things he was passionate about .   i became involved too .   i started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of suez .  then he died ,  and i loots the will to write it .   by the time i was over his death ,  other books had been published ,  and it wasn &apos;t worth going on . 
so i can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur . i shall be fulfilling a citizen &apos;s duty . 
it &apos;s a pity she couldn &apos;t make it up here today . 
she &apos;ll be here next weekend .   why don &apos;t you come too ,  james ?   i &apos;ll                       * show you the marshes properly .   if you &apos;re lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from siberia . 
did he ?   i left school and worked for the labour party .   my older brother ,  george ,  had just been killed in greece ,  and he &apos;d been an active member .   i hero - worshipped him .   he was 25 years old  .  .  .   it was an exciting time for us ,  those first couple of years after the war .   we thought the country was about to become a true democracy .   i can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time .   they feel betrayed .   they want to know what went wrong . 
give them here .   this tells you how the women &apos;s peace camp came to be set up .   all local women at first ,  then we had support from women and men all over the country . 
it &apos;s terribly good . 
why ,  is there a new foreign secretary ?   who was the old one anyway ? 
i know ,  i know !   gentlemen ,  let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to the cold war .   james penfield .   he wrote the opening chapter ,  on  &apos;the berlin airlift &apos; .   one of the best chapters in the book . 
i &apos;ll have some of that . 
and some of that .   sorry . 
good . 
are you going to have coffee ? 
so it &apos;s all worked out perfectly .  .  . 
everyone describes the same process .  at first it is exciting .   you &apos;re at the centre of the world .   as soon as anything happens ,  you &apos;re the first to know about it .   and there are deadlines a dozen times a day ,  even more ,  and that &apos;s intimidating and exciting .   then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off .   your a clerk in a rather dowdy office .   there &apos;s none of the glamour of television ,  or the penetration of serious journalism .   you &apos;re a processor of semi - official news .   some people leave at this stage .   then ,  if you hang on ,  and especially if you &apos;re promoted ,  you discover a new kind of pleasure .   you &apos;re pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts ,  by the way you ca judge length .   ending a broadcast on the dot ,  having everything run smoothly ,  selecting a running order that makes sense ,  knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do .   professionalism . 
you don &apos;t trust me . 
shall we have a drink or something ? 
we don &apos;t seem to get much time to talk . 
not here . 
not yet you know any of these people ? 
blas and epicene . 
 .  .  . an innocent interest ,  and found out that last year vogue ran a series called  &apos;mothers and daughters &apos; number seven ,  anne and susan barrington .   being a decent loving friend i went to the files and made a copy for you . 
she &apos;s never written a book in it ,  but she clearly knew a lot . 
it &apos;s obvious what you have to do .  your way into the daughter &apos;s pants is through the mother ,  up the suez canal .  .  . 
she &apos;s very nice ,  apparently .   lives in norfolk .   and very left - wing .  you &apos;ll have to watch yourself there . 
delivering gossip and goodwill .  it seems we &apos;ll both be doing brighton .   perhaps you should come too . 
do you want to hear my list of english kings and queens ? 
it &apos;s that lady from norfolk again . 
everyone &apos;s been marvellous really ,  jimmy .   the neighbours come and sit with her while i &apos;m at work . 
i &apos;ll tell you another thing .   we might have led the world once into the industrial revolution ,  now we lead with television commercials .  we &apos;re the best ,  it &apos;s as simple as that .   even the americans will admit it now  .  .  .  the camera work ,  the acting ,  the scripts ,  special effects .   we &apos;ve got the lot .   nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films .   that food you &apos;re eating . 
susan told me that your visits to norfolk had  .  .  .  well ,  an ulterior motive . 
you weren &apos;t really interested in suez at all .   incredibly enough ,  you were interested in my wife . 
you &apos;re so famous now . 
darling susan .   you look like an angel .   but where &apos;s your hat ? 
ah ,  susy ,  it .  .  . 
the only way to win out here is to surrender .   you have to feel what the wave is doing ,  accept its energy ,  get in sync .   just feel it all moving in the blackness .  .  .  you don &apos;t need to see . 
we gonna jump or jerk off ? 
you &apos;re a fucking dead man -  -

oh well he must be a surfer . 
candle wax .   car wax .   mustache wax ?  could be anything .   guy &apos;s waxing his mustache at the beach .   gets sand in it .   wipes it off with a shoe .   shoe scuffs the counter . 
did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up ? 
i &apos;m ready to rock ,  angelo .   where you want me ? 
i can see that .   but forget it .  stick to tennis ,  or whatever you &apos;re good at .   miniature golf .   here ,  your number &apos;s 37 . 
what is it ?   you all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing ?  this is a line ,  right ? 
meaning you were expendable . 
those are cold . 
i .  .  .  i gotta go . 
billy .  .  .  what the hell &apos;s wrong with you ? 
billy &apos;s on it .   heat seeker .  pretty sophisticated for half - asses mountain boys . 
it was all bullshit .  all of it .  from the start .  .  .  you set us up ,  got us in here to do your dirty work . 
we &apos;ve got most of the flares ,  frags .  and two claymores just outside .  nothin &apos;s comin &apos; close to here without trippin &apos; on somethin &apos; . 
that &apos;s over the border ,  general . 
what have you got in mind ,  general . 
what &apos;s he got ? 
what in god &apos;s name .  .  .  ? 
how could anyone get through this ,  carry blain out ,  right under our noses without leavin &apos; a trace ? 
what i did with those companies was perfectly legal . 
of course ,  yes .   after the expected< / u> filing period is over ,  i &apos;m going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid . 
stop .   for just a moment .   mr .  kross ,  i &apos;d like to ask you a few questions before< / u> you sign .  you realize that you &apos;re a target .  if you weren &apos;t mine ,  you &apos;d be someone elses ,  correct ? 
no ,  you look like a hooker . 
must be dangerous .   hooking . 
very good .   you ought to have that printed up on your business card . 
what do you charge for company ,  vivian ? 
uh - huh . 
not .  .  .  quite . 
know what we &apos;re gonna do in a little while then ?   we &apos;re gonna call domino &apos;s and have &apos;m deliver a bigass pizza .   we &apos;re gonna eat it in bed .   we &apos;re gonna veg &apos; out and watch television . 
i thought i was the pro .   these women make me feel like an amateur . 
clean the slut up ,  take her out ,  huh ?  !   what are you trying to prove !  ?   i &apos;m not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends ! 
i &apos;ve been with stinking old men who &apos;ve made me want to puke but i &apos;ve never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight . 
can we talk about this ?   can you just try to calm down ? 
what if i lose it ? 
if it &apos;s in italian ,  how will i know what they &apos;re saying ? 
one more night and you &apos;re finally rid of me . 
it &apos;s all just business to you .  him .   me .   your life .  everything &apos;s business . 
you &apos;re packing . 
mr .  harris ,  a guest of yours ,  is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly .   the young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge . 
what time &apos;s diner tonight ? 
goddamit !   where is he getting the money to fight ? 
put the pension funds on hold until i say otherwise . 
why do you want to know ? 
edward ,  we &apos;ve been together ten years . 
no ,  let &apos;s go to work .   okay ? 
looks slow tonight . 
i was asleep .   you woke me .   you okay ? 
he .  .  .  he just does . 
kit .  .  . 
yeah .  .  .  i know what you mean . 
all i &apos;m doing is feeling lousy about it .   i don &apos;t know what to do .   what do i do ,  kit ? 
i don &apos;t care about bucks .   i might love this guy . 
so whatta &apos; you going to do in san francisco ? 
don &apos;t give me that .   kit gave it to you yesterday ,  cash . 
are you looking for something in particular ? 
what ? 
if we surrender ,  and i return with you ,  will you promise not to hurt this man ? 
he will come for me . 
every ship but the four you sent . 
i killed him myself . 
i never said he was my dearest love .  and yes ,  he will save me .  that i know . 
rest ,  highness . 
faithfulness he talked of ,  madam .  your enduring faithfulness .  now ,  tell me truly .  when you found out he was gone ,  did you get engaged to your prince that same hour ,  or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead ? 
farm boy .  fill these with water  -  -    -  - please . 
i told you ,   &quot; i would always come for you .  &quot;  why didn &apos;t you wait for me ? 
we did it . 
i got married .  i didn &apos;t want to .  it all happened so fast . 
but it did .  i was there .  this old man said ,   &quot; man and wife .  &quot; 
well ,  no ,  we sort of skipped that part . 
we face each other as god intended .  sportsmanlike .  no tricks ,  no weapons ,  skill against skill alone . 
why is that ,  do you think ? 
it &apos;s fabric from the uniform of an army officer of guilder . 
you were supposed to be this colossus .  you were this great ,  legendary thing .  and yet he gains . 
oh ,  you &apos;ve a great gift for rhyme . 
hello . 
i don &apos;t think more than ten . 
has it been fifteen minutes ? 
you &apos;ve been mostly dead all day . 
well ,  maybe i was a little bit concerned .  but that &apos;s not the same thing . 
i &apos;m telling you you &apos;re messing up the story ,  now get it right ! 
it was ten days till the wedding .  the king still lived ,  but buttercup &apos;s nightmares were growing steadily worse . 
what ?  what ? 
form a brute squad then .  i want the thieves &apos; forest emptied before i wed . 
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m quite familiar with that phrase . 
 -  -  and then my tongue ,  i suppose .  i killed you too quickly the last time ,  a mistake i don &apos;t mean to duplicate tonight . 
your guess is as good as mine  -  - 
you know ,  it &apos;s very strange  -  -  i have been in the revenge business so long ,  now that it &apos;s over ,  i don &apos;t know what to do with the rest of my life . 
we &apos;ll wait until you &apos;re ready . 
i admit it  -  -  you are better than i am . 
as i told you ,  it would be absolutely ,  totally ,  and in all other ways ,  inconceivable .  no one in guilder knows what we &apos;ve done .  and no one in florin could have gotten here so fast .  out of curiosity ,  why do you ask ? 
you &apos;re that smart ? 
you feeling any better ? 
wait a minute .   this is a very big decision .   it might effect the course of my entire life .   i &apos;ll have to think about it .   i &apos;ll do it . 
 &quot; by the light ,  by the light , 
 &quot; of the silvery mooooon , 
go !   you have fifty - eight seconds . 
this is hardly a time for levity .  i &apos;ve discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play . 
yes .   right .   good thinking .   you figure it out .   i &apos;m tired .   i &apos;m gonna take a little nap .   wake me if there &apos;s a fire . 
yes ,  what ? 
what was i saying ? 
what do you mean ? 
mr .  bialystock .   no .   wait .   please .  you &apos;re holding me too tight .   i &apos;m an honest man .   you don &apos;t understand . 
okay .   i &apos;m way over here .   is that better ? 
what kind now ,  leo ? 
max ,  i don &apos;t want to take any siegfried oath .   i don &apos;t know what it is ,  but i don &apos;t want to take it .  we might end up in the german army . 
what are you doing ? 
what is she gonna do here ? 
 &quot; i &apos;m a yankee doodle dandy  .  .  . 
my play ?   you mean ,   &quot; springtime for  .  .  .   &quot;  you know who ? 
i vas vit him a great deal ,  you know . 
oh ,  sure .   i used to take him his hot milk and his opium .   achhh ,  those were the days .   vat good times ve had .   dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen ,  singing und dancing .   you know ,  not many people knew about it ,  but the fuhrer vas a terrific dancer . 
but he has long hair ! 
not . 
now ve take the two fuse leads ,  attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve &apos;re in business . 
no ,  not at all sir ,  we &apos;re quite serious .   we want to produce your play .   i have the contracts right here . 
six months ,  i &apos;m out on probation ,  but it &apos;s cool now ,  baby . 
he &apos;s the only cat left that still grooves me . 
you out to buy a motel ? 
no .  at least i don &apos;t recall . 
she arrived kind of late ,  wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early . 
no !  of all .  .  . 
why should she ?  i &apos;m sorry ,  i have work to do ,  mr .  .  .  if you don &apos;t mind .  .  . 
not at all ! 
i live there .  alone . 
sick old women are sharp .  come on ,  i won &apos;t disturb .  .  . 
somebody better tell me what &apos;s going on and tell me fast !  i can take so much and then .  .  . 
casharoonie ! 
go ahead !  spin it around the block .  now i know you don &apos;t know anything about engine condition ,  but you can feel ,  can &apos;t you .  .  .  and it &apos;s all in the feel ,  believe me ,  you feel that one around the block .  .  . 
no ,  m &apos;am .  i was only about to say ,  i &apos;ve sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test .  .  .  that &apos;s all . 
you better run out to the house .  she may be .  .  .  unable to answer the phone .  .  . 
he didn &apos;t mention the money .   what he said on the phone isn &apos;t important ,  is it ?   he was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother ,  and he didn &apos;t !  that &apos;s what i want you to do something about ! 
you should &apos;ve called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped .  you go starting private investigations ,  using people you don &apos;t even know .  .  . 
yes ? 
i need to .  .  .  i need to believe something .  this is the first time i &apos;ve ever come up against anything i couldn &apos;t .  .  .  understand . 
nothing .   just .  .  .  all the lights out .  .  .  must be asleep . 
where &apos;d you go to college ? 
i suppose .  .  .  when you were able to marry her she &apos;d have presented you ,  all shiny and proper .  .  .  she always tried to be proper . 
you going to wait here for me ? 
sam ,  if you owned a useless business like this motel .  .  .  one you probably couldn &apos;t even sell .  .  .   what would you need to get away ,  to start a new business ,  somewhere else ?   forty thousand dollars ? 
there must be some proof that exists right now !  something that proves he got that money away from mary .  .  .  some way ! 
what ? 
it &apos;s regular .  okay ? 
i &apos;ve heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels .  they say it .  .  . 
i wish i were .  not an active criminal but .  .  .  a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal .   next best thing to no conscience at all . 
not even just to see you ,  to have lunch .  .  .  in public ? 
and after the steak .  .  .  do we send sister to the movies and turn mama &apos;s picture to the wall ? 
hey ,  we can leave together can &apos;t we ? 
we have twelve vacancies .  twelve cabins ,  twelve vacancies .   they moved away the highway . 
your home address .  oh ,  just the town will do . 
i imagine so . 
you go out .  .  .  with friends ? 
only my share . 
why do you ask that ? 
what do you mean about caring ?   have you ever seen one of those places ?  inside ?  laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you .  .  .  and my mother there ?   why ?  has she harmed you ?  she &apos;s as harmless as .  .  .  one of these stuffed birds . 
phoenix ? 
why don &apos;t you stay a little while ,  just for talking . 
you slept here all night ? 
is there ? 
in the course of my duty ,  i never  &quot; take up &quot;  anyone &apos;s time ,  whether it &apos;s to give a warning ,  or a ticket ,  or help !  believe that ,  m &apos;am .   now if you woke up on the wrong side of .  .  .  the car seat ,  that &apos;s one thing .  but when you act as if i &apos;ve just placed you under arrest .  .  . 
mary is lila &apos;s sister ? 
we thought ,  if you didn &apos;t mind ,  we &apos;d go out to the motel with you . 
why don &apos;t you call norman and let him say just what happened ,  if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off .  .  .  it &apos;ll make the girl feel better ,  albert . 
recluse .  kinder word . 
norman ?  sheriff chambers .   been just fine ,  thanks .  listen ,  we got some worries here .  did you have a man stop out there tonight .  .  .   well ,  this one wouldn &apos;t be a customer ,  anyway .  a private detective ,  name of .  .  . 
barefaced . 
i always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance .  yet there you are ,  doing all the listening !   you are alone here ,  aren &apos;t you ?   it would drive me crazy . 
you look frightened .  have i been saying something frightening ? 
where will you get the money to do that ,  bates .  .  .  or do you already have it .  .  .  socked away .  .  .  a lot of it .  .  . 
 .  .  . forty thousand dollars ! 
i won &apos;t have you bringing strange young girls in for supper .  .  .    .  .  . by candlelight ,  i suppose ,  in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap ,  erotic minds ! 
they thought she &apos;d be coming to me . 
yes . 
now wait a minute ,  sam .  you sure you saw an old woman ? 
by gosh ,  them stiffs are get -  tin &apos; heavier and more of  &apos;em every day .  they even got the coroner working overtime . 
he hardly knew of them him -  self .   i believe it was his uncle in australia . 
then you knew of the inheritance ? 
sure -  - they &apos;re sorta queer ,  i &apos;d say .  they &apos;s lots of queer goings on up there .  they even brought a dog back to life once . 
it may be ,  but to my notion ,  those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later . 
oh ,  i see .  cats &apos; fur . 
i &apos;m detective jones .  just dropped in to tell you a bit of news . 
how do you do . 
dr .  meirschultz ,  please . 
what is it now ? 
you &apos;re losing your blood ? 
that spoke to you ? 
why didn &apos;t you eat last night ? 
you wouldn &apos;t get mixed up with that little rotter ,  would you ? 
but why ?  she &apos;s the best friend i &apos;ve got . 
are we going to have the same quarrel over again ? 
if you will forgive this poor ,  crippled stump ,  my dear ,  i am very happy to know you . 
we &apos;ll be coming to the opening . 
are you giving me this straight ? 
charming .  more delightful people crippled . 
and how does one go about getting these human documents ,  may i inquire ? 
why the goose pimples ?  if he wasn &apos;t social register  -  -  if it was somebody like me ,  you &apos;d be trying to hang him . 
except that he disappeared when things got too hot . 
whooey  -  -  he took a run - out powder . 
no ,  there &apos;s another point i want to iron out . 
that &apos;s what i said . 
yes ,  sir .  i got in the cab and it was layin &apos; there on the floor . 
you didn &apos;t happen to be going to worth &apos;s place ,  did you ? 
uh - huh .  do you remember what she said ?  what did you talk about ? 
you weren &apos;t going with her ? 
that happens to be the truth . 
not even then .  the police are the proper people to conduct this affair .  now if you &apos;ve got any suspicions i &apos;ll drive you to the nearest police station . 
i told you i didn &apos;t want to mix in it . 
there she is !  you &apos;ll find joan gale in that box . 
to isolation .   to an armed camp .   to a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son . 
mia .  .  .  ? 
i &apos;ve been dreaming about you . 
a place you &apos;ve never been . 
what did it want ? 
she must have gone out for a walk with the children . 
they &apos;re filthy ,  mother . 
promise not to tell doll ?   -  -  or nobody ?  buddy ,  it &apos;s your daddy !  i &apos;m so much in love with him i am out of my mind ! 
well ,  i thought they were more like a cantaloupe . 
why ,  buddy ,  shut your mouth !  what an awful thing to say ,  and where did you get any such idea as that ,  anyhow ? 
no !  you ought to be ashamed of yourself astin &apos; such a nasty things a child your age ! 
well ,  you &apos;re sweet ,  but you don &apos;t really love me . 
buddy ,  you &apos;re just a child . 
here comes daddy . 
rose ,  you must know who the fellow is . 
he thought he could sell  &apos;em ,  but nobody but country folks eat rabbits ,  buddy ,  and they ain &apos;t got no money .  we had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves .  every dern one ,  and it took about four years to eat  &apos;em all up . 
neither do i . 
i do ,  too ! 
he did lie ,  and .  .  .  and .  .  .  and mother ,  yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook ! 
i never saw anything like it .  how did she pick him up so fast ? 
see that ,  son ?  now this is a heel ,  see ,  and there ,  that &apos;s the ball of a foot .  someone has been walking here . 
well .  well ,  what i mean is ,  you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him .  but look this ,  brother ,  it is even more interesting .  look at this mark here ,  and that mark over there .  now wouldn &apos;t you say those marks are the marks of a ladder ? 
i heard you talking .  hasn &apos;t rose come in ? 
your impression is very reassuring ,  brother .  of course she &apos;s had troubles ,  poor thing ,  but i sensed that was that the girl was like and i &apos;m glad to have it reconfirmed . 
all right ,  all right .  doll and waski are upstairs taking their nap ,  you go get them and bring them down to the living room .  where is the girl ? 
geccch ,  yehh ,  guhhhh ! 
excuse me ,  gotta go to bathroom . 
he had his hand on her titty . 
wasn &apos;t daddy wonderful ?  he wanted to kiss her some more and play with her ,  but he didn &apos;t ,  because he loves mother and all of us ,  and he loves rose ,  too .  isn &apos;t he wonderful ,  isn &apos;t he great ? 
what is rose going to do ?  where can she go ? 
what &apos;s goin &apos; on ? 
a baby .  .  .  and she isn &apos;t even married . 
it always gives me a funny feeling to come home .  dear old southland .  gone .  it &apos;s all gone ,  daddy  -  -    -  -  except you ,  you &apos;re still here . 
but .  .  .  but how ?  she was young !  rose wasn &apos;t old ! 
go ahead ,  doctor ,  i think i am following you . 
forgive my crudity ,  darlin &apos; .  i don &apos;t understand these deeper things the way you do . 
i don &apos;t think you understand her .  it isn &apos;t sex she wants ,  it &apos;s love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it . 
well ,  she &apos;s back . 
well ,  time will tell ,  won &apos;t it ? 
i don &apos;t intend to fire her ,  darlin &apos; . 
i can &apos;t stand that polecat .  they ought to hang him . 
rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed .   i hope she &apos;ll be all right ,  but i still think we ought to fire her . 
honey ,  rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life .  now i don &apos;t think  -  - 
ah ,  ha !  hold the phone !  no forwarding address ,  huh ?   in the shock of this brilliant move ,  i forgot something . 
reluctantly ,  i do .  it would be a blessing to her and everyone else .  the girl is oversexed and i say  -  -  spay her ! 
rose isn &apos;t oversexed ,  that &apos;s ridiculous .  if you &apos;re going to talk nonsense ,  i don &apos;t want to talk to you at all .  rose is exactly the same as the rest of us ,  except more so . 
why ,  that looks like dave wilkie , 
honey ,  he is mr .  right . 
why ,  i &apos;m not going to kiss you ,  you crazy girl .  now i &apos;m telling you again ,  get off my lap .  come on ,  rose ,  get up .  now you get up ,  i say ,  and stop this ! 
is anything wrong ? 
why ,  sure ,  always got time to get you a half - a - cup ,  and one of these days i &apos;m gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens . 
darlin &apos; ,  i &apos;ll take a taxi to the hotel .  you and brother can handle the girl &apos;s epizootics .  i &apos;ll just say one more thing .   rose ,  i told you you had a friend in mrs .  hillyer ,  didn &apos;t i ,  that she would fight for you like a tiger ? 
well ,  i know it ,  i just got the bill for it . 
i didn &apos;t mean to bite him .  he was hitting horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and .  .  .  and i bit him accidental . 
i didn &apos;t mean to bite him ,  i really didn &apos;t . 
and who ,  rose ,  may i ask ,  is that ? 
ye gods and little fishes ,  a fireman .  put on some clothes ,  rose ,  you &apos;re naked as a jay bird .  when you &apos;re dressed ,  come on downstairs .  i &apos;m afraid your friend billy is injured ,  where are his clothes ? 
well ,  i have got news !  i called long distance and spoke to cousin hop and you &apos;ll be glad to know ,  rose ,  i have found you a job ! 
yes ,  i am . 
ha ha ,  course you make a lot more .   what &apos;s that you got there ,  buddy ? 
i don &apos;t mean that the way it sounds .   imagine it ,  a book .  and i used to know you personal way back when .   tell me something ,  buddy ,  how do you dream up all that stuff ? 
heh heh heh heh ,  same old buddy ,  always jokin &apos; around .  almost as much of a joker as your daddy .   i saw your daddy a coupla years ago ,  i was up in glenville lookin &apos; at a motel site .  i guess that &apos;s where you &apos;re headed ,  huh ,  to see him ? 
um - m ,  well .  .  . 
well ,  no ,  i didn &apos;t actually . 
what &apos;s the matter with him ? 
of course she does and i must say i &apos;m puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital .  i should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill . 
yes ,  thank you ,  doctor . 
well ,  she has one mouth in ten thousand ,  i don &apos;t see teeth like that once in ten years .  her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth ,  but there isn &apos;t a cavity in her head ,  not a single one .  she has perfect teeth . 
when he was baby we called him  &quot; wa wa ,  &quot;  a baby name ,  you know .  you will find him a very good boy .  his brother can be bad and so can his sister ,  but waski is a very good boy .  and as you can see he &apos;s beautiful . 
what are you studying now ,  mrs .  hillyer ? 
are you going to get your degree soon ? 
rose ,  you &apos;re in an awful dither tonight .  what &apos;s the matter with you ,  honey ,  are you sick or something ? 
well ,  i think it &apos;s charming ,  rose .   but don &apos;t you think .  .  .  ah ,  the skirt is a little tight ? 
rose ,  that scruffy - looking man is out in the yard again . 
i don &apos;t think we ought to discuss this in front of the children . 
you see ,  rose ?  now that &apos;s the kind of dress you ought to wear . 
well ,  there &apos;s no reason you shouldn &apos;t go out ,  rose .  .  .  in moderation . 
i .  .  .  i can explain .  .  . 
what .  .  .  what makes you think you can order me around ?  ! 
a lincoln ?   what lincoln ?   lincoln continental ?   lincoln mark five .  .  .  six .  .  .   ? 
kittle .  .  . 
what &apos;d i say ? 
sons of bitches ! 
jiminy christmas . 
all i got is being a cop .   what do i do if i &apos;m not that ? 
i don &apos;t know what the problem is .  plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
who &apos;s been giving you history lessons ?   your bartender ? 
where we going ? 
happy independence day . 
you live like a pig . 
whoa ,  whoa .  .  .  it &apos;s gonna be alright . 
you plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it ? 
general jim beam ,  then . 
you mean taking bribes ,  and skimming busts and letting hoods walk ?  you mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest joe ? 
pardon me .  .  .  my mistake .   taking your thoughts in hand ,  huh .  .  .   ? 
i just think you should show some respect .   i mean ,  call me old fashioned ,  but 200 years ago when ben franklin and those guys signed the constitution and declaration of independence ,  they did that so we could all share in the freedom .  .  . 
you know what i mean . 
alright ? 
i &apos;m gonna get beside .   nena ,  you &apos;re gonna shoot out his tires . 
that &apos;s right ,  white bread .   give it up .   right now . 
alright .  .  .  how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together ?   find out who  &quot; a . d .  &quot;  is .   i got a quick errand to run .

you always did have style . 
admiral ,  we &apos;re in position .  all fighters accounted for . 
i can &apos;t do it ,  artoo .  i can &apos;t go on alone . 
to be a jedi ,  luke ,  you must confront and then go beyond the dark side  -  the side your father couldn &apos;t get past .  impatience is the easiest door  -  for you ,  like your father .  only ,  your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door ,  and you have held firm .  you &apos;re no longer so reckless now ,  luke .  you are strong and patient .  and now ,  you must face darth vader again ! 
shhh .  you have hibernation sickness . 
jabba &apos;s palace .

somehow ,  i got the feeling that didn &apos;t help us very much . 
someone who loves you . 
the code &apos;s changed .  we need artoo ! 
i &apos;m sure luke wasn &apos;t on that thing when it blew . 
lando ,  grab it ! 
look .  i want you to take her .  i mean it .  take her .  you need all the help you can get .  she &apos;s the fastest ship in the fleet . 
oh ,  dear .  his high exaltedness ,  the great jabba the hutt ,  has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately . 
in his belly ,  you will find a new definition of pain and suffering ,  as you are slowly digested over a thousand years . 
my goodness !  artoo ,  why did you have to be so brave ? 
oh ,  princess leia ,  are you all right ? 
now lock onto the strongest power source .  it should be the power generator .

hey !   what do you think you &apos;re doin &apos; ? 
does this help ? 
you mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time ? 
yeah ,  everybody thought so .   but me and teddy got a kick out of toons .   all toons .   we couldn &apos;t see the bad in  &apos;em .  and when this guy was accused of knockin &apos; over the first national bank of toontown ,  we took his case .   but when we looked into it ,  we found out he did do it after all .   we went to his house to take him in .   but he was wise .  he got the drop on us .  .  .  literally . 
a challenge ,  on my life . 
keep away the cats !  thou art like one of these fellows that ,  when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says ,  &quot;god send me no need of thee . &quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer ,  when indeed there is no need . 
farewell ,  my cuz . 
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste ? 
 &apos;tis he . 
such mortal drugs i have ,  but verona &apos;s law is death to any that utters them . 
i do spy a kind of hope ,  which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent .  if ,  rather than to marry paris ,  thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself ,  then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death ,  to chide away this shame .  no warmth ,  no breath shall testify thou livest  .  each part ,  deprived of supple government ,  shall stiff and stark and cold appear ,  like death .  now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed ,  there art thou dead .  thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the capulet lie .  in the meantime ,  against thou shalt awake ,  shall romeo by my letters know our drift ,  and hither shall he come .  and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua .  take thou this vial ,  being then in bed ,  and this distilling liquor drink thou off .  i &apos;ll send my letters to thy lord post haste to mantua . 
o ,  she new well .  thy love read by rote and could not spell .  come ,  young waverer ,  come ,  go with me ,  in one respect i &apos;ll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove ,  to turn you household rachor to pure love . 
as the custom is ,  in all her best array ,  bear her to church . 
o god .  did romeo &apos;s hand shed tybalt &apos;s blood ?  o serpent heart hid with a flowering face .  was ever book containing such vile matter &apos;s so fairly bound ?  o ,  that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace . 
what ,  daughter are you busy ?  need you my help ? 
juliet ! 
how art thou out of breath ,  when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath ?  is the news good ,  or bad ?  answer to that;
what ? 
he jests at scars that never felt a wound .  but ,  soft !  what light through yonder window breaks ?  it is the east ,  and juliet is the sun .  arise ,  fair sun ,  and kill the envious moon ,  who is already sick and pale with grief ,  that thou her maid art far more fair than she :  be not her maid ,  since she is envious; her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off .  it is my lady ,  o ,  it is my love !  o ,  that she knew she were ! 
 &#93 aside] shall i hear more ,  or shall i speak at this ? 
how camest thou hither ,  tell me ,  and wherefore ?  the garden walls are high and hard to climb ,  and the place death ,  considering who thou art ,  if any of my kinsmen find thee here . 
do not swear at all; or ,  if thou wilt ,  swear by thy gracious self ,  which is the god of my idolatry ,  and i &apos;ll believe thee . 
do not swear :  although i joy in thee ,  i have no joy of this contract to - night :  it is too rash ,  too unadvised ,  too sudden; too like the lightning ,  which doth cease to be ere one can say  &apos;it lightens .  &apos; sweet ,  good night !  this bud of love ,  by summer &apos;s ripening breath ,  may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet .  good night . 
so thrive my soul -  - 
come gentle night .  come loving black - browned night give me my romeo .  and when i shall die ,  take him and cut him out into little stars ,  and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun .  o ,  i have bought the mansion of love but not possessed ,  and though i am sold ,  not yet enjoyed .  o ,  tedious is this day ,  as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them . 
romeo .  what &apos;s here ?  poison .  drunk all ,  and left no friendly drop to help me after .  i will kiss thy lips .  happily some poison yet doth hang on them .  thy lips are warm . 
nurse ,  give leave awhile ,  we must talk in secret .  nurse ,  come back again; i have remember &apos;d me ,  thou &apos;s hear our counsel .  nurse ,  thou know &apos;st my daughter &apos;s of a pretty age . 
too great oppression for a tender thing . 
away ,  begone; the sport is at the best . 
pardon ,  good mercutio ,  my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy . 
a plague o &apos; both your houses . 
follow me close .  gentlemen ,  gooday .  a word with one of you ? 
you shall find me apt enough to that ,  sir .  and you will give me occasion . 
do you have it ? 
it &apos;s under your seat . 
it &apos;s good to see you &apos;ve all got such faith in our little undertaking . 
and you believed me ?   but it wasn &apos;t my people who did it . 
best beer in the world ?   budweiser for me ,  thanks . 
from interpol ? 
good christ !   can &apos;t you lose these jokers ? 
i still am . 
i &apos;m a patriate . 
where do you get off saying word one ?  all the time pretending to be one of us ,  it &apos;s the same thing we were doing ,  seamus and myself .   and here you are so high and mighty ,  like you &apos;re so different from the rest of us . 
i intend to .   this phone is wired like no other :  it &apos;s got an encryption chip and instant sat - a - link recognition ,  it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand .   with my custom hardware and this phone i can trace the target &apos;s cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes .  .  . 
that was a mistake ,  trying to kill you .  mikhi did it without consulting me ,  i &apos;d have never allowed it . 
do you have the material ? 
perhaps we could both go at the same time .  .  . 
here &apos;s yours . 
sit ,  sit .  .  .   would you like one ? 
if you &apos;re lying to me you poor excuse for a human being ,  i &apos;m gonna blow your brains all over this car . 
gregor ,  is that you ? 
so what do we do ? 
then i guess we &apos;re set . 
nobody &apos;s going to do that ! 
i &apos;ve never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through .   he &apos;s a cop ? 
so this is what ,  a test ? 
it &apos;s been known to happen . 
they call me swede . 
where is this broad ? 
is that right ? 
cigarette ? 
where to ? 
he says this is their block . 
help yourself .   since when do you smoke ? 
christ ,  i smoke a pack - and - a - half a day ,  and i tell myself i could be worse .   it &apos;s just so damned pleasurable . 
what &apos;s going on ? 
that there was a gun pointed at me . 
he &apos;s going back . 
fix it yourself ?   why are we even doing this ?   there &apos;s no need to run ,  christ .  .  .   you &apos;re a cop . 
you &apos;re with interpol  -  -  you &apos;re a cop . 
it isn &apos;t about money for me ,  not anymore . 
you know him ? 
tell me ,  sam :  why do you do this ? 
it is at that . 
i never made that claim . 
how could you have done that ? 
because i don &apos;t walk away . 
and now .  .  . 
tell me something first .   the package :  what was it ? 
what happened to it ? 
i told you ,  i quit . 
you slept with her ! 
you put everything on the line because you .  .  . 
doing well .   this is ? 
what i &apos;ve heard so far ,  it &apos;s all a lot of talk .   i wasn &apos;t so sure what to make of it at first ,  cause ,  like i said ,  the irish and the russians are an unlikely mix . 
we don &apos;t know that . 
well someone &apos;s gonna find them . 
i don &apos;t know !   son of a bitch !  who the hell are you ? 
well neither have i ,  but it &apos;s us or him .   if he talks ,  or writes a note ,  or whatever ,  he &apos;s gonna turn us in .   besides ,  he &apos;s a low life scumbag .   his kind is hardly even human anyway . 
look .   dwayne was right .   this is going to be a big story .   so big in fact that i don &apos;t want to even have this money around . 
no we didn &apos;t .   he died on his own . 
i should have known something like this was going to happen ! 
shit !   we &apos;re gonna have to get rid of him .   i &apos;m not letting some gangbanger ruin my life .   we can &apos;t risk it . 
you &apos;re thinking about killing him .  i can &apos;t do that .   no way .   i &apos;ve never killed a man .   never even shot at one . 
he &apos;s going to be trouble . 
you said that last time ! 
well what are we supposed to do ? 
you &apos;re crazy . 
how long is it going to take ?  ! 
it &apos;s gonna be o . k . 
do you have everything ? 
i don &apos;t know for sure ,  but why else would they head for the bank ? 
it &apos;s too late .  .  . 
that &apos;ll bring me down ,  too .  eventually .   you gotta know that . 
and you &apos;re solid on that ? 
you don &apos;t expect us to believe that do you ? 
you &apos;re only screwing yourselves over !   helllllp !   helllllp !   somebody !  !  ! 
yeah . 
nothing &apos;s wrong . 
let &apos;s just get out of here ,  get out of this  -  -  place .   we &apos;ll drop out ,  get a house have some kids ,  get a satellite dish .  .  . 
what makes you say that ? 
i don &apos;t know .

uh ,  no .  .  . 
mr .  curtis called us this afternoon .  the bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop .   came through a store called after midnight .   there &apos;s only four employees ,  none of them can tell us who passed them . 
some of it .   denning only handled a small portion of the total ,  but it looks like this was one of his bills . 
yeah ,  racy stuff ,  you know the kind ,  right ? 
do you know .  .  . 34 c ?   32 c ? 
aw ,  now thats gonna take time to clear !

secret service agent carter .   this is my calling ,  lee .  give me six months and i &apos;ll be in washington protecting a white guy . 
you &apos;re just jealous  &apos;cos the girl picked me .   i &apos;m tall ,  dark and handsome ,  you &apos;re third world ugly . 
i &apos;m not used to having a partner . 
benjamin franklin ,  he discovered electricity . 
we &apos;re slowing down .   this must be it . 
you &apos;ve been a good friend ,  james carter . 
that looks exactly like my uncle darrell . 
isabella ?   are you crazy ,  man ?   she almost got us killed .   she &apos;s setting you up again ! 
no you didn &apos;t !

stay out of it ,  carter .   you &apos;re going back to l . a . 
last time you needed my help i ended up in the back of a truck . 
you move well . 
the secret service almost busted reign at his casino in macao ,  but the place burned down before we could move in . 
master ching taught me . 
do you still have the bills ? 
 .  .  .  if your father were alive ,  i would be turning to him now .   i didn &apos;t blow up the american embassy ,  but i believe some of my people did .   my enemies are trying to frame me .   there is a war going on within the triads  -  -  and i am going to lose .   my name has been written into the book of death . 
if you reach for that gun ,  i &apos;m going to kill you . 
two americans have been killed on united states government property  -  -  this is our investigation . 
who the hell is that ? 
you don &apos;t move ,  you understand ?  !   you don &apos;t move ! 
fifty million !   are we talkin &apos; united states dollars ? 
what you did was dangerous and completely outside policy . 
bullshit a little .   you lied to me . 
you &apos;re full of shit .   do you understand what i &apos;m saying to you ?  full of shit ? 
that silly - ass look on your face . 
you &apos;re a regular god damn acrobat ,  aren &apos;t you ?   bet you feel real good makin &apos; me look like an asshole .

when a man steps in dung ,  it is obvious .   there is no need to rub it in his face .   the smell is the same . 
alright ,  listen ,  no bullshit just tell me straight :  did you really know the guy you were chasin &apos; ?

what a surprise ! 
hey ,  baby ,  it &apos;s cool .   captain just reassigned me to the feds . 
well .  .  i wouldn &apos;t want to be in the way . 
any demands yet ? 
why don &apos;t you assign one of your own men to this ? 
you understand what i &apos;m sayin &apos; ? 
this is not a good way to start a relationship ,  stickin &apos; a gun to a man &apos;s head ,  feelin &apos; around his personal equipment .   make him think you don &apos;t trust him . 
what &apos;s this little green wire coming out one side of the package ? 
you sonuvabitch . 
yes . 
when were you going to tell me you were not going with us ? 
i don &apos;t believe you .   my father was explaining to mr .  griffin .   that is how i found out . 
bob  -  -  are you making friends with this man ? 
actually ,  he only asked me one ridiculous question .   the rest weren &apos;t so bad . 
how could i be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as god intended ? 
that &apos;s it .   back to obedience school . 
i &apos;ll get the dress . 
i love his eyes .   i just believe they &apos;re listening to you . 
rub your ears . 
i didn &apos;t cook up a story .   i had a source . 
fisher ,  let him talk . 
look ,  he &apos;s running after her . 
ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support . 
yes ,  well ,  my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention .  .  .  negative attention is attention .  like when women whack you on the street because of your column ,  that &apos;s negative attention . 
guess you &apos;d know about that .   you &apos;re an entomologist ,  right ?   how &apos;s business ? 
i &apos;m not sure .   mr .  schullian runs the newsstand ,  he &apos;s our local bookie ,  you know ,  he &apos;s giving eight to one odds she won &apos;t .   he says she &apos;s so famous now ,  maybe vegas will give odds on her .   i &apos;m going to wait to hear what the pros say . 
well ,  i &apos;m off .   a reporter &apos;s work is never done .   mrs .  pressman ,  thank you . 
i think you &apos;d look good in red . 
yes ,  i am .   and who are you ? 
like her mother . 
you &apos;re going to be very disappointed . 
that &apos;s fair . 
too much . 
i think so . 
it was one of the most wonderful moments of my life .   cal ripken even applauded . 
what do you mean ?   it was incredibly romantic ! 
i &apos;ll have the same . 
i don &apos;t know ,  give me a minute .   are you all right with this ? 
i &apos;m the only goddamn person in there pulling for you . 
no ,  maggie ,  i defended you .  humiliating you is what everyone else is doing .   it &apos;s the theme of this party . 
it &apos;s fun !   it &apos;s high . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  bob .   she kissed me back . 
yes ,  you ! 
livid is good .   so what is it ,  maggie ?  you here on business ?   i saw your lamps .  they &apos;re terrific . 
used ? 
you were not .

i &apos;m going to kill myself . 
but you haven &apos;t lost your mystery !  you &apos;re very mysterious ! 
i &apos;m not worried about you and cory or cory and me or even that you &apos;re irreversibly screwed up .   but ,  maggie ,  you &apos;ve been like this since we were kids .   and i think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people &apos;s feelings ,  maybe it &apos;s time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own ,  like bob ,  if he &apos;s the one . 
a harmless joke . 
i hope i don &apos;t have to pay for that piece of information . 
the short one with black hair is your cousin irene  -  - 
we will ?   the symphony ?   okay .   i &apos;ll take you to the russian tea room for pelmeni .

oh ,  walter .   i don &apos;t deserve you . 
and this woman is a writer !  that &apos;s what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers . 
you are .   you &apos;re losing your mind .   what about walter ?

do you think at the end of the movie when she &apos;s in the wheelchair they can still do it ? 
what about the letter ? 
i need to know about him because .  .  .  he &apos;s involved with my sister .  .  . 
no ,  no ,  no ,  it &apos;s more like ,  who is he ,  does he have a sense of humor ,  is he nice  -  -  no forget nice ,  i &apos;ve got nice  -  - 
no .   not remotely .   i just want to find out about him . 
oh god ,  it &apos;s major .   he &apos;s kissing her on the lips .   i have to stop this . 
i don &apos;t even know him .   but i &apos;m having all these fantasies about a man i &apos;ve never met ,  who lives in seattle . 
i know ,  i know .   i do not want to move to seattle .   but what i really don &apos;t want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing i could have done something .  what do you think ?   it &apos;s just cold feet ,  isn &apos;t it ?  everyone panics before they get married ,  didn &apos;t you ? 
oh ,  please .   destiny &apos;s just something we &apos;ve invented because we can &apos;t stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental .

i &apos;m probably not interested in whatever you &apos;re selling . 
what was it that made you know ? 
no . 
i &apos;m sure he won &apos;t be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him . 
just because someone &apos;s looking for a nice guy doesn &apos;t make them desperate . 
do you know how much it costs to go to new york ? 
eighty dollars . 
just out of curiosity ,  how did they get our address ? 
just this one part ,  okay ?    &quot; i have been an excellent third - baseman for as long as i or anyone else can remember ,  and i guarantee you will not get one past me &quot; 
i figure we could go to new york ,  catch the knicks ,  and since we &apos;d be there anyway ,  obviously we &apos;d go to the empire state building  -  - 
okay ,  tiger .   time for bed . 
this is not a joke .   thank god victoria doesn &apos;t know .   it would really have hurt her feelings . 
dad ,  i was talking to jessica about reincarnation ,  and she thinks that probably you knew annie in another life . 
the reason i know this and you don &apos;t is that i &apos;m younger and purer so i &apos;m more in touch with cosmic forces . 
i have to have a life .   i have to do things that i want with people my own age .   it &apos;s none of your business who i am going out with .   i don &apos;t give a good goddam if you &apos;re angry  -  -

in the back of a nineteen and thirty -  one stretch hudson with a big ole &apos; trailer . 
last i knew .

y &apos;all come back . 
reiben ,  i want you to listen closely to jackson .   this is the way to gripe .  jackson ,  continue . 
where ? 
sir ,  i understand what you &apos;re doin &apos; ,  but i respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner . 
no white - walls ,  sir ,  there &apos;s a war on .   not there ,  you goddamned idiot ,  over there !   i can &apos;t help you ,  sir . 
a paratrooper named ryan .   he &apos;s going home ,  if he &apos;s alive . 
but you could have gotten killed and i .  .  . 
upham ? 
i wasn &apos;t made for this . 
the men said ,  nine . 
i wonder where they &apos;re going . 
i can tell what the gunners had for dinner . 
caen ? 
command isn &apos;t going to let them withdraw and the germans sure as hell aren &apos;t going to let them surrender . 
how about .  .  .  ? 
hold your fire ! 
what was the name of that kid at anzio ,  the one who got his face burned off ? 
no problem .   a pair of deuces ?   less ?  so what ?   i bluff .   it used to tear me apart when i &apos;d get one of my men killed ,  but what was i supposed to do ?   break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do ?   of course not ,  so i bluffed ,  and after a while ,  i started to fall for my own bluff .  it was great ,  it made everything so much easier .   sarge is that why your hand &apos;s been shaking ? 
what do you think ? 
reiben ,  i don &apos;t know what i &apos;d do without you .   sarge ,  keep ryan close to you and alive . 
captain ,  can i put in for a transfer ? 
so ,  you ever heard of employee discounts ?   my uncle sells shoes ,  gets twenty - five percent off everything in the line ,  got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen . 
i don &apos;t think so ,  captain . 
captain ,  could you please explain the math of this mission to me ? 
well ,  sir ,  in purely arithmetic terms ,  since when does six equal one ?   what &apos;s the sense in risking six guys to save one ? 
huh ? 
well ,  maybe not the captain ,  but the rest of us have mothers . 
well ,  sir ,  consider the possibilities .  a :   ryan is alive .   we have to take him back to the beach .   knowing you ,  you don &apos;t let him carry my gear ,  even though he really should ,  and we all get killed ,  trying to keep him alive . 
looks like they &apos;ve been having a hell of a party ,  here ,  captain . 
i have no fucking idea .   here we come .   cover me . 
continues firing .   cutting down the advancing germans . 
you set ?   sarge nods .

i don &apos;t know ,  i kind of like wade &apos;s idea about the cruise ship .   i &apos;ve never been to tahiti . 
demolition ,  right ? 
how do you do it ? 
this evening is over . 
hi . 
no ,  i &apos;m not married .   it &apos;s for my daughter . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  but they turned down your card .

hello constance .   it &apos;s me ,  lloyd .  .  .  nothing ,  i &apos;m just driving around .  .  .  she broke up with me .  .  .  what do i do ?   can &apos;t she come back ?   how can i get her back ?  .  .  .  i can &apos;t think ,  talk to me .  .  .  i fucked up .  .  .  i feel like crying .  .  .  she gave me a pen .   i gave her my heart and she gave me a pen . 
what does it say ? 
the world is full of guys .   be a man .   don &apos;t be a guy . 
lloyd ,  it &apos;s us . 
why ? 
i can &apos;t give you that .   this guy &apos;s been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years .   he &apos;s been getting it from every end .   i &apos;d love to hear his story . 
one hundred and twenty - five thousand and nine months . 
having taken a few courses at the university this year ,  i have glimpsed our future ,  and all i can say is .  .  .  go back . 
i didn &apos;t think anyone would get it . 
what are you doing ? 
god ,  i &apos;ll have to go on a plane . 
oh yeah .   there was ,  uh ,  somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio ,  and ,  uh ,  we got this telephone call ,  this guy is making a sound effects record ,  and he &apos;d gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream . 
but listen ,  if i had a friend in the same position ,  i would tell her to delay a year . 
you &apos;re not listening to me . 
dad ,  you and i have talked about this .   lloyd and i have talked about this .   believe me ,  this is well - covered territory . 
dad ,  in a million years ,  i would never give him a pen .   what &apos;s wrong with having some fun ?   i like him . 
dad ,  are you okay in there ? 
don &apos;t say that ,  it &apos;s not good for you .   you &apos;re .  .  . 
no noise ,  no sound ,  no movement ,  nothing !   hello ,  diane ? 
quick question  -  do you know who i am ? 
yeah ,  yeah ,  yeah .   you remember ? 
actually ,  i think that i .  .  . 
alright .   this is really great .   alright ,  we &apos;re going out .  it &apos;s a date .   it &apos;s a scam .   whatever ,  whatever ,  alright ,  i &apos;ll pick you up at what ,  eight o &apos; clock ? 
thank - you . 
nobody knew me before tonight . 
you &apos;re a great date .   i &apos;ve never really gone out with someone as basic as you . 
oh .

no . 
now ,  go into second .   little more gas .  .  .  yeah !   you can get  this whole problem .   now ,  maybe you downshift to first ? 
are you comfortable ? 
check your mail tomorrow .   i sent you a letter ,  a letter . 
yeah . 
 &apos;cause i &apos;m worried ,  did you just break up with me ? 
well ,  if we &apos;re friends ,  why can &apos;t we see each other ? 
you told your dad ? 
you do ? 
i &apos;m fine . 
good to know . 
how &apos;s it going ? 
no .   you just described every great success story .   alright ,  it &apos;s alright . 
no my brother ,  you have to go buy your own . 
pain ! 
jim court ? 
seriously ,  lloyd . 
hi ,  lloyd .   this is my eighth and final call .  .  . 
i know .   but then i reconsidered .    &apos;cause i figured out what i really wanna do with my life ,  what i want to do for a living is i wanna be with your daughter .   i &apos;m good at it . 
she can &apos;t still be angry at this ,  it &apos;s gotta get better . 
my car . 
you missed every one of your career counselling sessions .   call me obsessive ,  compulsive ,  but let &apos;s do this right now . 
lloyd ,  everybody in that party put something down on their record except you . 
yeah ,  hey ,  oh god .   listen ,  i wanted to .  .  .  i don &apos;t know you very well ,  you know ,  but i wanted to ask you ,  how did you get diane court to go out with you ? 
give me my firebird keys ! 
nothing &apos;s changed .   then again ,  something has changed ,  hasn &apos;t it ? 
i didn &apos;t ask you about the list ,  i asked you your name .

he looks great ,  though ,  doesn &apos;t he ?  i have to know  -  where do you get a suit like that ?   what is that ,  silk ?   it &apos;s great . 
oh ,  this is  &quot; good business &quot;  in your opinion .  you &apos;ve got to move them ,  the equipment ,  everything to czechoslovakia  -  it doesn &apos;t make any sense . 
the ss beat me up .   they would have killed me ,  but i &apos;m essential to the war effort ,  thanks to you . 
i mean where have you been ?  nobody &apos;s seen you around for a while . 
thank you . 
oh ,  god ,  you don &apos;t have a drink ? 
once the war ends ,  forget it ,  but for now it &apos;s great ,  you could make a fortune .  don &apos;t you think ? 
i could try to read this or i could eat my lunch while it &apos;s till hot .   we &apos;re doing well ? 
this ,  i don &apos;t know ,  maybe you can trade it for something . 
i &apos;ll talk to you later . 
i didn &apos;t do enough . 
it &apos;s got nothing to do with reality ,  oskar ,  i know it and you know it ,  it &apos;s a matter of national priority to these guys .   it &apos;s got a ritual significance to them ,  jews shoveling snow .

goddamnit i am getting so fed up with these re - writes .  it &apos;s like every five minutes there &apos;s a new script .  god ,  and you just know this all because of stab 2 &apos;s script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting . 
roman and everybody else went home for the night .  i &apos;m here for a make - up test . 
let them try .  you &apos;ll never find me .  i &apos;ve already gotten away with murder before .  for instance ,  maureen prescott .

it just occurred to me that i &apos;ve never snuck through your bedroom window . 
and i was home ,  bored ,  watching television ,  the exorcist was on and it got me thinking of you . 
i know .  he called again last night at tatum &apos;s house .

so .  .  .

then he dies .  right now . 
but you &apos;re doing so well . 
productive .  so they &apos;re closing down the school ? 
boy ,  you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer . 
i just turned 25 .  i was 24 for a whole year .

i like it .  it &apos;s .  .  .  sexy . 
what did mama tell you ?  when i wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law . 
you gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit ? 
it &apos;s deputy riley today ,  sid . 
that ghost mask is sold at both kroger &apos;s and walmart .  neither of which keep purchase records . 
they &apos;re pulling loomis &apos; account .  but it &apos;ll be morning before we see something .  you think he did it ?

you &apos;re evil . 
aha ,  randy ,  you gave yourself away .  are you calling from work ?  tatum &apos;s on her way over . 
don &apos;t start .  you know i don &apos;t watch that shit . 
good try ,  randy .  tell tatum to hurry .  bye now . 
looks like you fingered the wrong guy .  .  .  again . 
i thought blockbuster fired you . 
why would he want to kill his own girlfriend ? 
we could be like two grief stricken students and we &apos;ll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly . 
there are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie .  for instance :  1 .  you can never have sex .  the minute you get a little nookie  -  -  you &apos;re as good as gone .  sex always equals death .  2 .  never drink or do drugs .  the sin factor .  it &apos;s an extension of number one .  and 3 .  never ,  ever ,  ever ,  under any circumstances ,  say  &quot; i &apos;ll be right back .  &quot; 
you heard billy  -  -  shut the fuck up . 
do you believe this shit ? 
and not just killed ,  sid .  we &apos;re talking splatter movie killed - split open end to end . 
you sure i can stay over ?  my dad won &apos;t be back til sunday . 
good ,   &apos;cause i wanna swing by blockbuster and get us a video .  i was thinkin &apos; tom cruise in all the right moves .  you know ,  if you pause it just right you can see his penis . 
it &apos;s okay .  she was supposed to pick me up . 
but he &apos;s been so patient with me ,  tatum .  you know ,  with all the sex stuff .  how many guys would put up with a girlfriend who &apos;s sexually anorexic ? 
there &apos;s that sense of humor .  i knew it still existed .  ohh ,  sid ,  let &apos;s have some fun tonight . 
is this not cool or what ?  hey ,  sid ,  what happened ? 
how is it working for a scumbag like this ?  you proud of yourself ? 
what do you think ? 
what &apos;s this :   &quot; i &apos;m declining this case ?  &quot;   it don &apos;t work that way . 
come on .   what are you going to do with yourself out there ? 
thank you .   tell them ,  thank you . 
what do you mean ? 
what makes you so special that people should pay attention ? 
innocent ?   is that supposed to be funny ?  look at the people i killed .   an obese man ,  a disgusting man who could barely stand up .  .  .  who if you saw him on the street ,  you &apos;d point so your friends could mock him along with you .   who if you saw him while you were eating ,  you wouldn &apos;t be able to finish  your meal .   after him i picked the lawyer .   and ,  you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one .   this was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster .  .  .  to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets . 
you &apos;ve made a good life for yourself .  .  . 
somerset .  .  . 
i .  .  .  i don &apos;t follow . 
there &apos;s a bucket here . 
this is his stuff .   i &apos;ve been out in the cold all day . 
it &apos;s my wife . 
i &apos;d like you to meet somerset . 
you go to movies at least ? 
our guy got into office ,  probably before the building closed and security tightened up .   gould must have been working late . 
no witnesses of any kind ? 
you meant what you said to mrs .  gould ,  didn &apos;t you ?   about catching this guy .   you really want to believe that ,  don &apos;t you ? 
i wish i still thought like you . 
why would we ? 
and ? 
it is victor . 
by telling you this ,  i &apos;m trusting you more than i trust most people . 
it &apos;s probably nothing ,  but even if it is ,  it &apos;s no skin off our teeth .   the man at hot dog world is a friend ,  in the bureau . 
yeah .   some college student who &apos;s taking english 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on twentieth century crime . 
you &apos;re sure you &apos;re reading that right ?  john doe ? 
what are you going to say ? 
wait .  .  .  just wait . 
by the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead . 
what are you talking about ? 
the irony is ,  after a day of the type of work he did ,  he &apos;d come home and read me these morbid crime stories .   murders in the rue morgue .   le fanu &apos;s green tea .   my mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours . 
no .   face it now .   stop thinking it &apos;s good guys against bad guys . 
what the fuck is wrong with you ?   what burnt you out ? 
oh ,  you &apos;re so much better than everyone ,  right ?   no one &apos;s worthy of you . 
throw your weapon ,  detective !   now ! 
i feel strange being here with you .  .  .  without david knowing . 
why always like this ?   only after the fact .  .  .  this sudden realization ,  that if you shoot someone ,  or stick a knife in them ,  that person will cease to exist . 
how &apos;s california ? 
it was ethan found you squallin &apos; in a sage clump after your folks was massacred .  .  .

what do you know about it ?  .  .  . what &apos;s a quarter - breed cherokee know about the comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him .  .  . you got as much chance of stampedin &apos; their herd as .  .  . 
go on !  whyn &apos;t you have your bugler sound the charge while you &apos;re at it ?  ? 
if there &apos;s anything i can do ,  sir .  .  . 
why colonel greenhill is colonel greenhill ,  sir .  .  . commanding officer ,  fifth u . s .  cavalry .  .  . i &apos;m lieutenant greenhill ,  sir . 
my pa wants to know .  .  . colonel< / u> greenhill< / u> wants to know how soon you could put a company of your rangers in the field ,  fully armed and equipped ,  for joint punitive action against the comanches . 
unnt - meah ! 
steady ,  daniel boone !  you don &apos;t want to miss .  .  . it makes them think their medicine &apos;s stronger than yours .  .  . 
told ya ,  didn &apos;t i ? 
mose .  .  . try to remember !  .  .  . you were in scar &apos;s camp .  .  . 
and maybe you lie .  .  . 
my name &apos;s edwards .  .  . i &apos;m looking for my niece .  .  . she was in that camp when you attacked .  .  . 
nothing for you to see . 
you want us to fire a shot if .  .  . 
not so funny .  .  . if you recollect what  &apos;nawyecka &apos; means .  .  . 
least ,  they< / u> won &apos;t feed any comanches this winter .  .  . killin &apos; buffalo &apos;s as good as killin &apos; injuns in this country . 
no .  .  . she &apos;s not .  .  . 
 &apos;i ,  ethan edwards ,  being of sound mind and without any blood kin ,  do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to martin pauley .  .  .  &apos;  i don &apos;t want your property .  .  .  .   &apos;sides ,  what do you mean no  &apos;blood kin ?  &apos; debbie &apos;s your blood kin .  .  . 
i know you are .  .  . only it ain &apos;t goin &apos; to be that way .  .  . she &apos;s alive .  .  . 
hard to realize they &apos;re white ,  isn &apos;t it .  .  . 
why it &apos;s just a snip of calico .  .  . 
she &apos;s not a little girl any more . 
every young man should at least once .  .  . go on ,  laurie !  read ! 
they never find that girl . 
fetch what< / u> home ?  .  .  . the leavin &apos;s of comanche bucks  -  -  sold time an &apos; again to the highest bidder ?  .  .  . with savage brats of her own ,  most like ?  .  .  . 
do you know what ethan will do if he has a chance ?  .  .  . he &apos;ll put a bullet in her brain !  and i tell you martha would want him to ! 
so ,  how does it feel to be kissed by two women ? 
oh ,  the muse .  .  .  we &apos;re still having our differences .   you know how it is with women . 
i mean the armchair ! 
my father was an electrician .  already forgot that ? 
what are you doing ? 
i have a funny feeling .   do you think we &apos;ll get over all that &apos;s happened ? 
martin ,  it &apos;s not funny ! 
so ,  did you sleep good ? 
hey ,  you &apos;re still here .   i suppose you like it here with us . 
let me guess :   another short circuit ? 
will you finally cut it out ?   just in case you haven &apos;t noticed ,  i am trying to write a book here .   and maybe  -  even with your birdbrains  -  you can figure it &apos;s a pretty tough job .  so why can &apos;t you just leave me alone ? 
you know what i have to do now ,  and believe me :   i don &apos;t enjoy doing this . 
you know ,  tommi wants me to become the man i used to be . 
oh ,  ellen !   i &apos;ve been wondering when you &apos;d come .   why don &apos;t you step in . 
ellen straub . 
i guess it &apos;s too lonely for most folks .   it &apos;s time for me to get going .  it &apos;s been a pleasure meeting you . 
you didn &apos;t tell her ! 
hey ,  my man !   how &apos;s the masterpiece coming along ? 
yes ,  i &apos;ve seen you in something .  that one about a king . 
i gave shakespeare two sovereigns for romeo ! 
and what favour does mr .  tilney receive from you ? 
we have no juliet ! 
there is no dog in the first scene ,  will kempe ,  thank you .  how goes it will ?

black sue ,  fat phoebe ,  rosaline ,  burbage &apos;s seamstress; aphrodite ,  who does it behind the dog and
interesting . 
most interesting . 
and your relations ? 
will it restore my gift ? 
gentlemen !  thank you !  you are welcome . 
i saw his tamburlaine ,  you know .  wonderful . 
it &apos;s a comedy . 
and a share .  we will be partners ,  mr .  fennyman ! 
this time we take your boots off ! 
well ,  that will have them rolling in the aisles . 
i feel a scene coming on . 
cut round him for now . 
romeo . 
i insist -  - and a beaker for mr .  marlowe .  the barman does the business . 
two hours at prayer ! 
but silvia i did not care for much .  his fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons .  stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats !  oh ,  when can we see another ? 
playhouses are not for well - born ladies . 
your majesty . 
as stories must when love &apos;s denied -  - with tears and a journey .  those whom god has joined in marriage ,  not even i can put asunder . 
will ! 
but your voice  have they dropped ? 
like you ,  i found him not at home ! 
my lady ! 
i do not know how to undress a man . 
to be the wife of a poor player ?  -  - can i wish that for lady viola ,  except in my dreams ?  and yet i would ,  if i were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day . 
you lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed . 
calf love .  i loved the writer ,  and gave up the prize for a sonnet . 
you were not dead before .  when i thought you dead ,  i did not care about all the plays that will never come ,  only that i would never see your face .  i saw our end ,  and it will come . 
at sea ,  then -  - a voyage to a new world ? she lands upon a vast and empty shore .  she is brought to the dukeorsino . 
you will never age for me ,  nor fade ,  nor die . 
good bye ,  my love ,  a thousand times good bye . 
my lady viola . 
no .  i have spoken to the queen .   her majesty &apos;s consent is requisite when a wessex takes a wife ,  and once gained ,  her consent is her command . 
she wants to inspect you .  at greenwich ,  come sunday .  be submissive ,  modest ,  grateful and brief . 
bless me ,  i thought it was a horse . 
wait there . 
i think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance .  for what lady could live up to it close to ,  when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine ?  besides ,  can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a bankside poet and player ? 
you upstart inky pup !  now i will show you your place ,  which is in hell ! 
squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination . 
i saw my grandmother ,  of course ,  but i don &apos;t suppose that counts .  i mean ,  she was alive at the time . 
no . 
now what else ?  david i don &apos;t know . 
family ?  family ?  friends ?  drugged - up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck - ups don &apos;t have families ,  david . 
that was good . 
listen ,  it &apos;s important .  we need to talk about what we &apos;re going to do  -  - 
good luck .  i love that guy ,  but why does he have to follow us around ? 
what is this ? 
from what ?  jehovah &apos;s witnesses ? 
doesn &apos;t it worry you ? 
nothing . 
i want to secure it . 
what for ?  what did you want ?  the money ?  was that it ? 
it wasn &apos;t deep enough .  i told you it wasn &apos;t deep enough ,  but you wouldn &apos;t listen . 
no ,  can &apos;t think of anything else that matters . 
animals involved ?  i know ,  but you need a change .  and besides ,  we &apos;re short . 
is this being recorded ? 
it looks like he &apos;s writing everything down . 
no .  why should it ? 
just one thing . 
right . 
well ,  cameron ,  are you comfortable ? 
good .  well ,  you &apos;ve seen the flat ? 
and you like it ? 
yes .  it is ,  isn &apos;t it ?  we alllike it .  and the room &apos;s nice too ,  don &apos;t you think ? 
when you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands ,  do you then summon hellfire ? 
when you get up in the morning ,  how do you decide what shade of black to wear ? 
god ,  you two are sensitive .  all i &apos;m doing is implying some sort of sordid ,  ugly ,  sexual liason .  why ,  i &apos;d be proud of that sort of thing . 
in a moment he &apos;s going to tell he could have been someone  -  - 
 -  -  which is  -  - 
you see ,  they don &apos;t really know me . 
have you seen hugo ? 
maybe he didn &apos;t like us . 
he &apos;s got a car ? 
so ? 
now ? 
i don &apos;t want to .  it &apos;s different . 
be careful . 
sshh . 
you know ,  you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it .  that &apos;s my advice . 
i don &apos;t see the point in that . 
we have to talk . 
he won &apos;t do anything for me ,  but for you  -  - 
he isn &apos;t safe up there .  if you really cared about him ,  you &apos;d use your influence to get him down ,  then he &apos;d be safe . 
of course ,  but i think you &apos;ll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed  -  - 
what ? 
two ? 
i see . 
no ,  they were asleep .  they didn &apos;t even wake up . 
yes . 
just get on with it ,  alex .

it &apos;s alright .  i think he got the message anyway . 
in this firm . 
accounting ,  david ,  chartered accounting  -  - 
but they sneer ,  don &apos;t they ? 
hello .

no .  you know too many sick ladies . 
i &apos;d like to do your hair sometime . 
that you &apos;re just like your mother . 
what sort of references do you have ? 
george ! 
you &apos;re late ,  george . 
where do you want to do this ? 
she &apos;s incredible .  .  .   she loves you ,  george . 
 .  .  .  i don &apos;t get it done often . 
bernstein .  .  .  seemed to think i hated men . 
it &apos;ll ruin everything .

i am ,  i am .  but i &apos;ve had it with chicks .  they &apos;re like an occupational hazard .  six guys working for me .  .  .  i &apos;m gonna retire or settle down or something .

felicia says you &apos;re a very good hairdresser . 
well ,  george ,  i invest for a lot of people .  i make a lot of money for them .  more than they could do for themselves . 
but personal services are not the kind of thing i usually get into . 
you look like you &apos;ve had quite a work - out .

 -  -  jackie really shouldn &apos;t drink  -  -

are you sure ? 
it &apos;s like i go to sleep ,  and he shows me things but when i wake up ,  i can &apos;t remember everything . 
no ,  i &apos;m scared of nothing here .  it &apos;s just that you know some places are like people ,  some shine and some don &apos;t .   i guess you could say the overlook hotel here has something about it that &apos;s like shining . 
yeah . 
jack .  .  .

huh ? 
yeah ,  winesburg ,  ohio ,  was never like that .  .  .  but i got something that just might cheer you up . 
no -  we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face . 
well .  .  .  it &apos;s a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws .  also ,  i checked on the otic solution .  it was counter brand .  no prescription needed . 
yeah ?  really ? 
so have i ,  actually .  .  .  i wish it could always be like this . 
i haven &apos;t enjoyed mass this much in years .   what a marvelous program .  innovative .   inspiring .   you are to be commended . 
let thy spirit
he &apos;s .  .  .  dreamy .   he &apos;s .  .  . 
sing ! 
for the first time in i don &apos;t know how long .   i wanted everything done right .  open and above board .   i told father antonelli i was in love .   i told him it was a special love ,  for all the ages . 
babe ,  what happened here ?   look at you . 
look at that .   get a gander . 
the minute i saw you .  i said to myself ,  she &apos;s a weaver .   have you ever used a loom ? 
two days .   an hour or so . 
that machine . 
mary patrick  -  -  do you remember the dixie cups ? 
what is it ,  mary ? 
but then came an angel who whispered these words
yeah ,  for one second .   that was the blend  -  -  you &apos;ve got to listen to each other .   be a group . 
don &apos;t look at your feet ,  and i don &apos;t want to see anybody counting .   make it look easy .   again ! 
come on ,  we &apos;re late . 
what ? 
thanks .   so which one are you ?  sister bruce ?   sister doug ? 
mary clarence ! 
mary robert ,  i am so sorry about last night .  .  . 
it &apos;s contraband .   don &apos;t ask .   but i wanted to give you a treat .   a sort of .  .  .  thank - you gift . 
but the lord came to me
the mary is in deference to the holy mother ,  the clarence in honor of saint clarence loyola .   there are three vows that every nun must accept .   the vow of poverty .  .  . 
sisters ,  for the rest of the day we shall declare a vow of silence . 
surely you are familiar with this practice ,  mary clarence .   only when our lips are silent ,  can our prayers truly be heard . 
a fast .   to remind us of the poor ,  of those who must endure without enough to eat . 
right .   so what do we do now ?   ping -  pong ?   row over to the monastery ? 
deal with it ,  sweet thing .   it &apos;s important ,  nowadays .   you just practice at home ,  with a balloon and a banana . 
a balloon and a banana !   tell me ,  mary clarence ,  what were you thinking ? 
this is a convent ,  not a clinic .   we offer moral guidance ,  not hardware . 
so .  .  .  hi there . 
mary clarence ,  perhaps you are correct . 
but  -  -  why ? 
what are you doing here ? 
then i guess you &apos;re stuck .   life sentence .   no parole . 
i hate you .   i totally hate you . 
but i &apos;m going insane !   all these people do is pray and work ,  work and pray !   i don &apos;t get it  -  -  when &apos;s the weekend ?  they have gruel ,  eddie ,  that &apos;s what they call food !   gruel  -  -  it &apos;s like alpo for nuns !  i sleep in a cell ,  on a board ,  and i pray five times a days  do you know what i pray for ,  eddie ,  do you have any idea ?  check your crotch ,  eddie  -  - anything fall off yet ?   get me outta her ! 
what &apos;d she say ? 
does she know people are trying to kill me out there ? 
we could put you into our witness protection program . 
we &apos;re looking for mike . 
but you didn &apos;t tell me ! 
right . 
get her ! 
so that guy in the bar was right ?   she &apos;s like .  .  .  some kind of nun ? 
she was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car . 
are you going to shoot us all ,  tough guy ? 
it should be here any minute . 
yes ,  mary patrick ? 
mary clarence has a background in music .  that &apos;s what reverend mother said . 
ice cream ! 
mary clarence ,  don &apos;t be silly .   you &apos;re an example to us all .   you &apos;ve taught us so much .   we &apos;re singing for the cardinals ,  and then  -  -  who knows ?   maybe the choir can travel  -  -  to schools ,  and nursing homes . 
the little sisters of the moonlight ! 
not a note . 
absolutely not .   i am very sorry ,  but no . 
i lied . 
and who are you to talk ?   you were nothing .   you couldn &apos;t even sing .   i must have been out of my mind . 
she &apos;s .  .  .  she &apos;s a nun . 
we haven &apos;t heard your name yet ,  friend . 
i say ,  is there any one person suspect in these acts ? 
we must be a curious sight to him . 
he is dead .   you would be also ,  if your wound had not somehow shut . 
stains of blood . 
you are so upset now .  .  .  and yet ,  you seemed in such good spirits last night . 
he will be burned pursuant to statutes of health . 
very few ,  if any . 
why would he flee this direction ,  with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover ? 
listen to what you say .  .  .  . 
what is the common thread between these victims ? 
the lenape indian had much to tell once i opened his mouth . 
out there .   what do you see ? 
are you familiar with magnets ? 
thank you . 
follow the indian trail to where the sun dies .   to the tree of the dead .   maybe we passed it by . 
what does it mean .  .  .  climb down to the horseman &apos;s soulless place ? 
what is it ? 
must be some sort of gateway .   but ,  why this place .  .  .   ? 
all i saw was their lantern . 
only the heirs were killed .   proof that the horseman slaughters by assignment . 
what now ?   where is she ? 
she &apos;s the one who controlled the horseman ,  isn &apos;t she ,  sir ?   sir ?  
won &apos;t you change your mind ,  sir ?  what can i say to convince you ? 
what now ? 
forgive me ,  i didn &apos;t know . 
is it me ,  or are you this nervous around all women ? 
people have put their trust in you . 
what are you on about ? 
and this gives worth to butchery ? 
my god .  .  .  what has happened ? 
what .  .  .  what are you doing .  .  .   ? 
you cannot kill what is already dead . 
van ripper .   can you show where the body lay ? 
here .  .  .  in front of this oak ,  facing north .   horrible .  .  . 
there was not much blood ,  was there ? 
van ripper ,  turn the coach about ! 
the lenape who lived in these woods .  .  .  do you know him ?   the redman ?   i should tell you .  .  .  he has been murdered . 
i hear him .   he rides to the hollow and back . 
imagine my surprise ,  finding him on a liason with a common servant .   a girl who had apparently become his secret love . 
she has confessed . 
there was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss ,  one old boy from california and one old boy from arkansas .  old boy from california says ,   &quot; boy this water &apos;s cold .  &quot;  old boy from arkansas says  &quot; yeah ,  and it &apos;s deep too .  &quot;   get it ?  that &apos;s a goodun .

how come ? 
are you well ? 
hey there .  i thought i heard somebody on the porch .  wasn &apos;t your name karl ? 
this is what i call my secret place  &apos;cause i come out here when i feel like bein &apos; by myself .  i used to come here with karen cross .  she &apos;s kind of like my girlfriend ,  or used to be .  she says she likes jerry maroney now .  but i &apos;m gonna get her back  &apos;cause i love her .  we used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight .  she didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with me in front of other people  &apos;cause i don &apos;t have any money .  well ,  mama and me ,  i mean .  she seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though .  she said she loved me ,  too .  out here .  settin &apos; right on that stump you &apos;re on .  see ,  her daddy &apos;s a dentist so they &apos;re rich .  so &apos;s jerry maroney &apos;s daddy .  he owns the ice plant .  was your folks well off ? 
it ain &apos;t the truth .  he shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose . 
were they bad people ? 
well ,  i hate him . 
i like the way you talk . 
yeah ,  me too .   that was nice of that woman to give you them flowers . 
i kind of like you tellin &apos; me what to do and not to do .  just like my daddy .  i didn &apos;t mind him tellin &apos; me .  i hate doyle to tell me what to do .  mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us .  that we can &apos;t leave him or he &apos;ll try and hurt her . 
why not ?  it died ? 
you threw it in a trash barrel ? 
seems like doyle &apos;s wormed his way back in .  mama said he &apos;s stayin &apos; over tonight and he &apos;s talkin &apos; about movin &apos; in for good .  we ain &apos;t ever gonna be happy .  we &apos;ll always be nervous ,  won &apos;t we karl ? 
hey ,  karl .  how &apos;d you know to come out here ? 
maybe you can make more sense out of them than i can .  i made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on christmas . 
how come karl won &apos;t eat here with us ? 
karl ,  now listen ,  there &apos;s gonna be a party tonight here at the house .  doyle &apos;s invited his music - playin &apos; buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio . 
well ,  at least he &apos;s tryin &apos; .  but who knows for how long . 
i know honey .  just remember what i said ,  we &apos;ll bide our time .  you just steer clear of him as much as you can .  doyle &apos;s had a real hard life .  it &apos;s just about run him crazy i think . 
these is the worst shoes i own for walkin &apos; .  how far did you want to go ? 
i &apos;m ye oldest boy name karl . 
i ain &apos;t got nothing but them books . 
karl ,  what in the world are you doing here ? 
she &apos;s talkin &apos; about me ,  karl .  that &apos;s my first name . 
you scared me . 
thank ye . 
hit ain &apos;t right for me to keep from tellin &apos; you how come me to be put in the state hospital . 
you &apos;re a hell of a boy ,  frank .  someday you &apos;re gonna get all the good things you deserve .  and karl here &apos;s gonna get some more biscuits tonight .  what do you think about that ? 
why are you here now ? 
yes sir . 
that boy wants me to . 
i reckon i can stand to eat a little somethin &apos; or  &apos;nother at noontime tomorrow .  bill cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters .  but i reckon he can lay off doin &apos; it tomorrow . 
hey ,  you &apos;re the one that wanted to major in journalism .  anyhow ,  wasn &apos;t the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it ,  it was twenty - five years ago ,  he probably doesn &apos;t even remember it . 
can &apos;t you talk to him ?  maybe talk him into it .  i &apos;m a real good interviewer .  just get me in the room with him . 
you see ,  karl ,  growing up ,  only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it .  he couldn &apos;t really read but ,  well ,  neither could his mother .  but ,  his father made sure that his mother knew what the bible said .  and she made sure karl knew .  you know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed ,  right ? 
it &apos;s the best you &apos;re gonna get .  i &apos;m sorry . 
yes . 
melville ,  huh ?   it &apos;s been a while . 
it &apos;s been a while .  i thought maybe you &apos;d be in touch . 
i finished my story .  i thought you might want to take a look at it . 
good .  i hope you like it .  it was a long time in coming . 
seven eighty - five out of twenty .   take care of yourself now ,  and don &apos;t do anything i wouldn &apos;t do . 
i &apos;d like to see your pictures some day . 
i &apos;ve never seen anything like it . 
amazing .   i &apos;m not sure i get it ,  though .  i mean ,  how did you ever come up with the idea to do this  .  .  .  this project ? 
what do you mean ? 
but they &apos;re all the same . 
i &apos;m thinking about the kid .  i &apos;m sure he &apos;d do a good job for you . 
he &apos;s got something to tell you ,  auggie . 
it could have been worse .  if the cops hadn &apos;t come ,  i might not be standing here now . 
you haven &apos;t heard from rashid ,  have you ? 
yeah ,  great .  the problem is ,  i have four days to come up with something ,  and i don &apos;t have a single idea .   you know anything about christmas stories ? 
every word . 
it was a good deed ,  auggie .  it was a nice thing you did for her . 
stop it ,  already .  just stop all this crap right now .   was that your idea to call her felicity ? 
yeah ,  well ,  i lost my pen .  by the time i got a new one ,  i was clean out of paper . 
you weren &apos;t so lukewarm yourself .  at least at first . 
you &apos;re conning me ,  sweetheart .  i ain &apos;t responsible for no baby . 
get in ,  auggie .  i &apos;ve got something to show you . 
so you &apos;re just going to give up and go home ? 
she &apos;s just a kid .  there &apos;s time for more babies later .  after she grows up . 
jesus god ,  auggie .  there &apos;s money in here . 
fuck this angel shit .  just take the dough ,  ruby .  but no bawling ,  okay ?  i can &apos;t stand people who blubber . 
lovely . 
they catch you smoking tobacco ,  they &apos;ll stand you up against a wall and shoot you . 
no thanks .  i don &apos;t care what you do ,  but just make sure you don &apos;t get caught ,  okay ?  the last i heard ,  it was still illegal to sell cuban cigars in this country . 
i &apos;ll be back in about an hour .  watch the register while i &apos;m gone ,  okay ? 
what do you care where it comes from ?  it &apos;s yours . 
i &apos;m looking for my nephew ,   thomas . 
no ,  i don &apos;t suppose it has .  he was broken up like nobody &apos;s business in that hospital when he found out louisa was dead . 
i don &apos;t know what you look like ,  boy .  as far as i can tell ,  you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night .   you live in this town  -  -  or on your way from here to there ? 
thomas . 
i don &apos;t like this .  i don &apos;t like it one bit . 
i don &apos;t know .  hello ,  mom .  hello ,  dad .  something like that . 
what are you talking about ? 
i don &apos;t drink coffee .   on the other hand ,  since you insist ,  if you offered me a cold lemonade .  i wouldn &apos;t say no . 
time to wake up .   hey ,  kid ,  time to wake up .   rashid !   up and out .  i have to work in here .  the slumber party is over . 
a little less clumsiness around here would be nice ,  don &apos;t you think ? 
three nights . 
where did you get that thing ? 
cut it out ,  will you ?  just cut it out and come back here . 
close the door .   sit down in that chair .   now listen carefully .  your aunt em came here a couple of days ago .  she was sick with worry ,  out of her mind .  we had an interesting talk about you ,  thomas .  do you understand what i &apos;m saying ?  your aunt thinks you &apos;re in trouble and so do i .  tell me about it ,  kid .  i want to hear all about it right now . 
i just happened to be walking by .  .  .  all of a sudden ,  the creeper and this other guy come running out of this check - cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands .  .  .  they just about ran smack into me .  the creeper recognized me ,  and i knew he knew i recognized him .  .  .  if the guy from the check - cashing place hadn &apos;t rushed out then screaming bloody murder ,  he would have shot me .  i &apos;m telling you ,  the creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk .  but the noise distracted him ,  and when he turned around to see what was happening ,  i took off .  .  .  one more second ,  and i would have been dead . 
you &apos;re joking ,  right ?  i mean ,  that &apos;s your way of trying to be funny ,  right ? 
once a story gets hold of you ,  it &apos;s hard to let go .   besides ,  i &apos;m making up for lost time . 
if i tell you ,  i might not be able to finish it . 
here we are .   rembrandt &apos;s drawings .  edward hopper .  van gogh &apos;s letters . 
uh ,  actually ,  i tend to shy away from that kind of thing . 
his only copy .   i mean ,  if you think you &apos;re going to die ,  what &apos;s more important ,  a good book or a good smoke ?  and so he huffed and he puffed ,  and little by little he smoked his book . 
i don &apos;t know . 
and started to run . 
so you lost the job .  is that what you &apos;re telling me ?  he just up and fired you ? 
if it doesn &apos;t make any difference ,  why not just say it ? 
the battery &apos;s in ,  that &apos;s done with .   besides ,  you &apos;d do the same for m .  .  . 
$1200 an acre ,  that &apos;s what i paid ole ,  won &apos;t take a dime less .   you got no choice on that . 
none . 
and when he came home .   did he write you about this ?   or phone ,  perhaps . 
yes ,  and then ,  what was there to call about ?   everything was up in the air . 
because the facts could be misconstrued as murder . 
he &apos;s still got a good grip .   we need to dig more . 
there can &apos;t be any wrong in this ,  ha .  .  . 
you have to hear this ,  i can never touch you ,  ishmael .   not once ,  not ever .   there &apos;s no half -  way .   as much as i know it hurts you ,  you have to let this go . 
it was my specialty ,  sir ,  i trained several thousand over the years . 
well ,  what then ,  sergeant ? 
and replaced it later with the new one .   that &apos;s your inference ? 
well ,  i was a doctor in the jap theater ,  in the war .   i saw those kendo wounds ,  many< / u> times .   looked exactly like this one . 
objection .   asking witness to speculate about deceased &apos;s state of mind . 
maybe it went .   where carl went .  over the side . 
then putting them together .   so truth is revealed . 
mr .  jurgensen .   did he offer to buy< / u> the seven acres from you ? 
didn &apos;t go anywhere else ?   no errands ,  no purchases ?   just straight to the boat .   that &apos;s the truth . 
well ,  the sheriff found two< / u> batteries in your well .   if you left one with carl heine ,  how is that possible ? 
you said three minutes . 
never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place . 
you gonna climb that with one arm ? 
it &apos;s the way it happened ,  i know it is . 
your daddy .   was quite a feller . 
tell us why that lantern would be so significant . 
now you believe there were two< / u> lanterns when defendant arrived .  one in carl &apos;s hand .   the second lashed to the mast . 
what makes you think i play ? 
you wouldn &apos;t even see it move . 
so every time you think about showing that jury strength .   or honor or composure .   or dignity . 
and what &apos;s that ? 
does it now ? 
you found three batteries ,  you say .   a d - 6 and d - 8 in the well .  and a spare d - 8 on the cabin floor .  correct ? 
is it possible his head struck the transom ,  or the stern gunnel ,  or the net roller ,  as you were bringing him in ? 
you don &apos;t .   think< / u> so . 
so this .  .  . foam you found in the lungs .   how does it get there ? 
that &apos;s why< / u> the autopsy report identifies drowning< / u> as the cause of death . 
can you tell whether an object moved against the head ,  or the other way around ?   or would both look the same . 
for certain ,  no . 
can i say something ,  here ? 
well ,  he didn &apos;t say  &apos;no &apos; ,  did he ?  didn &apos;t say no hope existed . 
melton ,  on the double !   up a chain !                                    melton  sir !      melton takes a few easy strides ,  gracefully catches a chain mid -  stride ,  and smarts up ,  climbing easily and twice as fast as todd .      church ,  sloan ,  and rubrick crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters .      three quarters of the way up ,  melton comes even with todd ,  then passes him .  mekum ,  watching ,  smirks .      church is watching too ,  and he &apos;s still not satisfied .   his brow is knit ,  something &apos;s bothering him .      angle high above ,  among the girders     stonefaced ,  melton is resting an a  &quot; platform &quot;  on the chain ,  sixty feet up ,  beneath the girders ,  swaying gently .      his stony gaze is on the next chain where todd is arriving at a  &quot; platform &quot;  on an adjacent chain .  .  . only three feet away .      their eyes meet ,  todd and melton alone together sixty feet up ,  three feet apart .   neither man blinks ,  neither man flinches ,  neither man reveals anything at all .  .  .      low angle ,  looking up     church considers the men high above ,  then to mekum .                                    church                    what about .  .  . spirit ?

joe ,  if we get out of this hotel alive ,  you know what we &apos;re going to do ?  we &apos;re going to sell the bracelet ,  and grab a boat to south america and hide out in one of those banana republics  -   the way i figure is ,  if we eat nothing but bananas ,  we can live there for fifty years  -  maybe a hundred years  -  that is ,  if we get out of the hotel alive .   did we forget anything ? 
sugar ? 
hello ,  my dearest darling .   so good to hear your voice again . 
what &apos;ll i tell him ? 
she sings ,  too . 
oh  -  sugar ! 
i &apos;d better stay here till she goes back to sleep . 
i &apos;m not crowding you ,  am i ? 
when i was a little girl ,  on cold nights like this ,  i used to crawl into bed with my sister .   we &apos;d cuddle up under the covers ,  and pretend we were lost in a dark cave ,  and were trying to find out way out . 
and you &apos;ve got cold feet . 
so spill it .   spills ,  thrills ,  laughs ,  games  -  this may even turn out to be a surprise party .

fight the power ! 
the problem is you don &apos;t allow your children to think for themselves .  you try to raise them in a protective bubble ,  and then when they finally get old enough ,  they realize they &apos;ve been lied to ,  and they resent you for it . 
oh ,  phillip .   this cannot be good . 
saddam ,  would you let me do my job please ! 
hey fella !   relax !   this whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out .  let &apos;s make love . 
i told you not to make that deal ,  saddam ! 
why should she ,  it &apos;s her fault .  all guests are told not to eat in zero gravity ,  but she just wanted to have fun i guess ,  didn &apos;t realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery . 
no ,  i just ran it !   why are you running it again ? 
yes i &apos;m sure i hit the right commands . 
well ,  everything &apos;s running smoother than a baby &apos;s ass .

idiot .  .  . 
well that &apos;s your call .   doesn &apos;t make a damn bit of difference to me .   just as long as i get my cut . 
now i got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod !   you &apos;re just gonna have to pick me up later . 
good .   now you &apos;ll hear from me when i have the new coordinates .  in the meantime don &apos;t bug me . 
sure .  it complies with all standard construction codes . 
and suppose you couldn &apos;t hold out ? 
you &apos;re ready for the real thing ? 
i guess i owe you a debt of gratitude .   you saved my life . 
what &apos;s that ? 
he &apos;s out of the equation .   talk to me . 
i never thought this would happen .   no premonitions ,  nothing . 
i would ,  but no one can perform the ceremony .   i guess it doesn &apos;t matter . 
i haven &apos;t quite made up my mind yet . 
yeah but the ship &apos;s mainframe doesn &apos;t .  i need you to tell it something . 
but the corridor outside this door is open ,  correct ? 
hey ,  ain &apos;t i seen you on the tour ? 
look ,  faz ,  mr .  kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you .  .  .   what was that he said .  .  .  ? 
your pop said to put these on his tab .  sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door . 
sure ,  sid . 
bowling police ,  step back ,  give him room . 
think he bought it ? 
yeah ,  and make it extra muddy ,  i didn &apos;t sleep a zee last night .  sheila fills a cup .  buzz lifts it to his mouth ,  his hands trembling . 
and look at that; both partners go down together .  kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor ,  stands up ,  and crushes it under his heel .  he goes over and puts his arm around buzz . 
buzz fazeli . 
remember the finals in akron in  &apos;59 ?  you had a seven - ten split in the final frame . 
ten thousand to one ,  but you pegged it .  the toughest shot on the last frame . 
you &apos;re a bullshit artist ,  that &apos;s what you are .  you got no right to be here !  theo yanks the trophy away from buzz . 
i do what i gotta do to survive . 
i &apos;m more of a bowler than you &apos;ll ever be .  i deal with my own shit .  i ain &apos;t asking anyone to bail me out . 
he &apos;ll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life . 
the whole world thinks you &apos;re underground . 
what about bowling ? 
i looked in his car .  he &apos;s got pictures of you ,  clippings ,  maps . 
hello ? 
how &apos;s that ? 
knock - knock . 
no ,  junior ,  you shouldn &apos;t touch her . 
i have someone for you to play blueface with junior . 
a guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling .  you got ambition like a .  .  . like a .  .  . blowtorch .  you go for what you want and anything that gets in your way  -  pssshht !   -   shish kebabs .   maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good .   i think i could help you ,  theo . 
where &apos;s junior ? 
you &apos;re just like you mother !  always jealous ! 
leave him alone ! 
132 ,  154 . 
i &apos;m a bowler . 
then i &apos;ll have the number four with one of your finest whips . 
you and your sideburns are the talk of the party ,  theo . 
my mom told me not to stay in this town . 
yeah ,  but they &apos;re all little wannabes .  i &apos;m looking for a professional man . 
how much would you charge me for the lips ? 
what the hell did you go doing that for sheila ?  we haven &apos;t even gotten naked yet ! 
why did you come back ? 
theo ,  buzz is dead . 
back to plan a .  the vicious cycle all over again .  theo lets go of sheila . 
what makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum ?  huh ? 
lips still for sale ? 
some unfinished business . 
aagh !  stop !  those are my bowling fingers ! 
why is junior &apos;s watch in that coffin ?  something stinks around here . 
i am not leaving without him .   do you hear me ?   we come down as a team ,  we leave as a team . 
the surface ships will be back .  after the storm clears . 
fifty yards and closing . 
it sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface .   but we &apos;ve never used it underwater before . 
what was that ? 
anything else ? 
you talk to any reporters ?   any press ? 
good .   security &apos;s been our biggest worry .   now that you &apos;re here we can shut this thing down tight . 
not really ,  no .   something of the military crashes in the ocean  -  -  it explains why there was nothing on the news ,  why you &apos;ve kept everything a secret .  .  .   when did it crash ? 
see this ?   coral .   geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick . 
like  &quot; thou shall not kill &quot;  ? 
going active . 
what the hell ?   it shut us down . 
yes ,  sir .   i &apos;m here . 
i see it . 
subs are still at surface ,  sir . 
we know how this craft got here .  where it &apos;s been . 
no .   they don &apos;t represent a message .  they aren &apos;t decorative at all .   they have another purpose entirely . 
man is man ,  all he knows is man ,  and all he can think of is what he knows .   the anthropomorphic problem .  good ,  norman . 
gimme a report ,  i want  -  - 
who is that ?   where &apos;s that coming from ? 
are you enjoying yourself ,  harry ,  because i don &apos;t know what the hell you &apos;re doing . 
edmunds ?   get in here .   i want to know exactly how this is being transmitted . 
what about< / u> a crowbar ? 
ted ,  get her away from the door . 
look at this . 
well ,  until we know exactly what it is ,  nobody goes outside ,  understood ? 
that ulf report everybody &apos;s patting me on the back about ? 
what do you expect ?   for them to bring it up here ? 
isn &apos;t there a psychological term for that ,  dr .  johnson ? 
 .  .  .  when i was six ,  my younger brother and i  -  -  we went swimming in the pacific .   at my mother &apos;s beach house .   we both felt stinging ,  and when we came out of the water ,  he was wearing jellyfish head to toe .  killed him . 
you knew about the squid not being normal .   before fletcher went out there ? 
i didn &apos;t do anything wrong .   i didn &apos;t mean .  .  . 
yeah ,  he told< / u> you .   think .   what was barnes doing before they cut that cable loose ?   he was on the phone .  except that cable is a thousand feet long ,  norman .   they would &apos;ve broken off communication with us four ,  five minutes before they cleared out . 
it &apos;s not worth the risk . 
you should know how it works .   just in case . 
yes ,  norman .   i did .   you &apos;re just nervous . 
still clear ? 
deserts you ?   harry said he &apos;d take over for me . 
none of this was here before . 
damn it ,  norman .   i swear .   i had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up . 
you think it &apos;s me ?   you think i &apos;m saying there was a conversation when there wasn &apos;t ? 
he translated it wrong . 
ulcers . 
riordan ? 
doesn &apos;t say . 
you ever given an injection before . 
how do you feel about snakes ? 
do you fear them ? 
are you manifesting them ? 
he can &apos;t manifest . 
beth you &apos;re losing it .   c &apos;mon . 
you &apos;re lying  -  - 
that &apos;s when you went in the sphere . 
this is what i &apos;m talking about ,  norman .   don &apos;t you see ?   it &apos;s in you .  this vindictiveness .   this rage . 
of course you &apos;re going to deny it .  you want to blame someone else .   you want to blame beth .   because you hate beth . 
beth ,  stop it ! 
oh please ,  don &apos;t shrink me ,  norman .  not now . 
don &apos;t tell me about me .   i already know too much . 
what is that ?   what are you doing ? 
pussy . 
yes you did .   norman ,  i wouldn &apos;t leave you out there .   you know that . 
jerry .   right .   i said jerry ,  didn &apos;t i ? 
just in time ,  too . 
our habitat ,  i mean .   this place can &apos;t handle another attack . 
how are you feeling ,  norman ? 
don &apos;t be defensive . 
i mentioned it in my report .   didn &apos;t you read the report ? 
not a clue . 
so ,  we know< / u> .   we know it went through a black hole .   we saw it .   norman  -  -  when we &apos;d get to the surface ,  we &apos;d tell someone about the black hole ,  wouldn &apos;t we ?   it &apos;d go in some report like some big discovery .   so in fifty years when they build that ship ,  they &apos;d make precautions for a black hole .   but they didn &apos;t< / u> .   the called it an unknown entry event . 
i can &apos;t .   if i had a minute to think ,  maybe ,  but i know you &apos;re wrong . 
it &apos;s what &apos;s in that sphere ,  isn &apos;t it ,  harry ?   whatever you think is in that thing  -  -  you think it &apos;s going to kill you . 
norman ? 
what happens on page 87 ?   have you ever read page 87 ? 
it &apos;s the squid !   stop it ! 
did i kill her ? 
i can &apos;t reach her . 
missed . 
gimme a second  -  - 
you know how to work this thing ? 
what does norman already know ? 
a spacecraft half a mile long  -  -  with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it ?   someone went to a lot of trouble .   try again . 
we take a weeny little wedge ,  bang on it a couple of times ,  and bust off a chunk of the metal .   yet any spacecraft  -  -  even at a low velocity ,  say 200 miles an hour  -  -  crashes into the water  -  -  it &apos;s gonna be like hitting concrete ,  it would crumple like paper .   but there isn &apos;t a dent to be seen anywhere .   not even a scratch . 
what &apos;d you say ? 
by the way sir ,  i &apos;ve read your report .   i think it &apos;s brilliant . 
he &apos;s manic ,  norman .   you know that ?  this reliance on harry is misplaced .  you hear me ?   totally misplaced .   he &apos;s overlooking things .   obvious things . 
take a look .   i rearranged the numbers .   put  &apos;em up to the light .   go ahead .   squint at it . 
well ,  how about we wait and see what harry comes up with ? 
you think jerry has something to do with what killed edmunds ?   with what &apos;s out there ? 
jerry isn &apos;t hostile ,  norman .   he said earlier  -  -  we were his friends  -  - 
what kind of a crash was it ? 
there &apos;s a u . s .   navy car outside ,  norman . 
we have to find he rebels .  .  .  what we &apos;re carrying belongs to them . 
how much do you think she &apos;s talking about ? 
don &apos;t look at me .   i &apos;m just a pilot .  i got you here .  .  .  you &apos;ve got to do the rest . 
you saw through me ? 
yes .   it was a black day .   one of my disciple &apos;s took the crystal and became a sith lord .   it was a black day .   the few crystals that remain are in the possession of the sith lords on alderaan .   that &apos;s how they &apos;ve become so powerful . 
when we get artoo &apos;s message to them ,  you think they &apos;ll try to rescue the princess ? 
i can &apos;t do it .   i &apos;ll get hit . 
the kiber crystal . 
the plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system .  .  .  our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness ,  which we will determine from the data i stored in artoo . 
we must hurry to the base .   we have little time before the death star arrives . 
you got yourself a ship .   we can leave as soon as you &apos;re ready . 
something has happened to them .  let &apos;s try this way .  .  . 
get to the ship ! 
i noticed you were having some problems ,  blue five .  .  .  i thought i &apos;d help . 
and you ? 
according to my father &apos;s tapes ,  this is the spot where general kenobi lives ,  but the instruments just don &apos;t match up with the landscape .  .  .  there is no doubt about it ,  we &apos;re lost .  .  . 
level five ,  detention block a - 23 ,  cell 2187 .   she &apos;s still alive .  .  . 
holy maker ,  threepio .   i forgot .  .  . 
what makes you think .  .  .  you &apos;ll make .  .  .  squad leader ,  rico  ? 
funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out . 
dizzy says you two knew this rasczak character in buenos aires .  .  . 
you still haven &apos;t kissed her yet  ?  don &apos;t lie . 
i &apos;ve been thinking about applying for federal service ,  too .  fleet ,  maybe . 
i &apos;m eighteen .  it &apos;s my decision ,  i think i &apos;d make a pretty good pilot .  i &apos;ve good great reflexes .  you need that for maneuvering ,  you know . 
you always told me you couldn &apos;t do human .  .  . 
in simulation ,  my supervisors could never keep up . 
if we &apos;re gonna be a team ,  why not be a real team  ? 
carmen .  .  .  ? 
i thought i was dead .  lucky for me you jokers showed up ,  eh  ? 
none at all .  .  .  we won . 
he just got accepted to the fleet academy .  isn &apos;t that great  ? 
hey ,  carl ,  what &apos;s wrong  ? 
let &apos;s all make a vow .  let &apos;s swear we &apos;ll always be friends no matter what . 
you talk to carl  ? 
com &apos;on ,  just say it .  try it on for size . 
what happened to your hair  ? 
 .  .  . i &apos;m sorry . 
well ,  look at this .  the three of us back together again . 
where &apos;s lieutenant barcalow  ? 
hey ,  amigo ,  come chow with me .

why did you go and do that  ?  he was all ready to go zegema beach  ! 
 .  .  . cut off  ! 
wait a minute  !  carl is doing his federal and he isn &apos;t inferior .  he &apos;s the smartest kid at school  ! 
i don &apos;t understand it ,  lieutenant .  it &apos;s not getting anything from 4th brigade .  .  .  not even their transponder . 
seeing as how we &apos;re about all that &apos;s left of  1st brigade ,  you &apos;d have to call that an improvement .   you top kick  ? 
i always wanted to go to zegema beach . 
who said you could grow up so fast  ?  last time i checked you were only five years old .  you had such a bright little face .  .  . 
i don &apos;t know what they teach at harvard ,  but i think i &apos;m pretty good enough the way i am  ! 
hello .  .  .  oh ,  johnny .  .  .  ! 
we &apos;re outa here .  lieutenant ,  get your men into the skimmers .  this real estate &apos;s about to go buggy . 
that would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective .  they hang you for that ,  rico . 
the exact words of the text .  but do you understand it  ?  do you believe it  ? 
well ,  my parents are against it ,  and i know it &apos;s my choice ,  but i was wondering .  .  .  what would you do if you were me  ? 
all dead except one ,  sir . 
yopu asked me some advice once ,  rico .  want some now  ? 
what &apos;s that look like to you ,  rico  ?

this is my farm .  get on the boat ,  now  !  that &apos;s an order ,  sergeant . 
they have repressed the creator .

as i stated ,  v &apos;ger calls to the creator . 
it is a courier ,  captain .  grade one priority .  non - belligerency confirmed . 
mr .  chekov ,  when do those devices activate ? 
yes . 
we &apos;ll have to replace commander sonak .  i &apos;d still like a vulcan there ,  if possible .  .  . 
stop competing with me ,  decker ! 
captain ,  we &apos;ve seen what their weapons can do .  shouldn &apos;t we take every possible precaution  -  -   ? 
i advise caution ,  captain; we can &apos;t withstand another attack . 
why bring us inside ?  not to destroy us; they could have done that outside . 
negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub - light speed . 
lieutenant ilia reporting for duty ,  sir .

reporting as ordered ,  captain . 
also  -  -  there was nothing in your report about why< / u> you &apos;re here . 
the  &apos;puzzlement &apos; i sensed was fleeting .  .  .  minor .  .  .    .  .  .  as if carrying a sense of our insignificance ,  captain . 
child .  .  .  !  ? 
v &apos;ger plans to literally meld< / u> to reduce both itself and the creator to patterns .  .  .

but like ,  what do you like to do when you &apos;re not working ?

consuelo ,  what is rape exactly ? 
no ,  you don &apos;t . 
i mean ,  why are you making this documentary if you can &apos;t treat your subject with appropriate gravity ? 
i dunno ,  toby .  we really have a long way to go .  you still need a lot more footage ,  and it &apos;s probably a little premature to start screening
what &apos;s an audience going to tell you ? 
twinkeys ! 
mom ? 
hey ,  you want to hear my short story now ? 
well ,  actually ,  it &apos;s the same ,  but longer .  i think it &apos;s better .  more .  .  . raw . 
oh ,  i know ,  i know that .  well ,  sharing your story ,  your ups and downs ,  and so forth ,  can i hope ,  be an illuminating experience . 
hello ,  vi . 
i &apos;m sorry .  i didn &apos;t mean ,  i just didn &apos;t expect to run into you here ,  that &apos;s all . 
that &apos;s good . 
you have beautiful skin . 
it &apos;s over there . 
it &apos;s a really nice place you have .  is the rent high ? 
ni .  .  .

i know .  i &apos;m sorry .  i &apos;m just .  .  . a little nervous ,  i don &apos;t know why . 
scooby ? 
you a pervert ? 
what for ? 
hey ,  um ,  toby ?  i was wonderingis the documentary almost finished ? 
yeah .  he went to harward . 
i gotta keep you alive -  - it &apos;s in my contract . 
 -  - be prepared . 
let me tell you something cooper !  i never once bad - mouthed him during all those months -  - 
what about rule one :   never let the person you are protecting out of your sight ! 
well ? 
so ,  what are we looking at white ? 
well ,  it &apos;s a binary formula -  - a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work . 
have you broken it yet ?   we &apos;ve got six more heads and that means six more hours . 
agreed -  - let &apos;s move it . 
my crew is going to work alongside with your men ,  don &apos;t worry -  - we &apos;re a team ! 
well ,  there was uh ,  a little dissent about the amount of the bonus -  - 
are we adrift -  - 
get your men to do it ! 
just what the hell is he talking about ? 
well ,  it has been explained to me that ,  if you add a thick cobalt - thorium - g jacket to a nuclear device ,  the radio -  activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years . 
don &apos;t you dare touch me !   what the devil do you think you &apos;re doing ? 
mister president ,  i can &apos;t buy this malarkey; they wouldn &apos;t set the damn thing off .   why should they ? 
then all you have to do is untrigger it . 
my seven body orifices ?  ?  ?  ? 
why are you saying that phrase over and over again ? 
sure i do .   there was some kind of mutiny on the base ,  and you killed general ripper . 
on your feet ,  fella .   i &apos;ve got to get outside and see how my men are . 
operator .  .  . how much would the call be station - to - station ?  .  .  . thirty - five cents cheaper ?  .  .  . i &apos;d still be short twenty cents  .  .  . just a second ,  operator .  .  .   colonel ,  shoot the lock off the coke machine .   there &apos;s bound to be enough change in there . 
damn it !   damn it !   i &apos;ve been telling you all for years you &apos;ve got too damned many psychoes in the service . 
good .   has the wing confirmed holding at x - points ? 
yes ,  major .   this looks like it &apos;s going to be it . 
major ,  that &apos;s all i &apos;ve been told .   just got it on the red phone .   the base is to be sealed tight .   and i mean tight . 
that about right ? 
well ,  general  -  -  i was wondering ,  why are you doing this ?   i mean why do you want to start the war ? 
but even then ,  we wouldn &apos;t get everything .   i mean some missiles would abort ,  or they &apos;d miss their targets ,  or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don &apos;t know about . 
well ,  i know they &apos;ve been going on for years ,  and they haven &apos;t gotten any place . 
i &apos;ve heard the arguments .   like napoleon &apos;s quote ,   &quot; there &apos;s one thing you can &apos;t do with a bayonet ,  and that &apos;s  -  sit on it .  &quot; 
no ,  major ,  i don &apos;t .   they have no regard for human life .   they wouldn &apos;t care if they lost their whole country as long as they won . 
don &apos;t be offended ,  major .   our president holds the same views . 
do you think we &apos;d cheat ? 
major ,  those are my boys out there dying . 
have you received acknowledgements from every plane ? 
how long will it take to receive them all ? 
i believe it will be just a few minutes ,  at the most . 
general schmuck ,  are you positive of your figures ? 
general ,  stick to the point ,  please . 
maximum ecm . 
then this is it . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  major kong .   i guess i was way out of line . 
just the missiles . 
could you take her up right now ,  king ?   other -  wise we &apos;ll get kind of close to the fireball . 
lieutenant toejam ,  are you ready for bim and bam ? 
are you saying our order don &apos;t make sense ? 
release first safety . 
where &apos;d they get you ? 
how do you know he &apos;s dead ? 
he &apos;s dead ,  all right . 
our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders .   and therefore ,  to disregard anything that doesn &apos;t come on the crm - 114 . 
sure ,  king . 
uh ,  yeah ,  she should be coming by . 
i just walked all the way from westside to here .  i haven &apos;t walked that far since junior high .  i thought you didn &apos;t drink . 
can i have some ? 
did you ever hear that saying ,   &quot; this too shall pass &quot;  ? 
how long were you in there ? 
i mean ,  that would suck if you had to go back to rehab . 
we were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing .  we were getting off on the fact that we &apos;re in a car teen feet longer than all the rest .  and i got out and i just started walking . 
yeah ,  but ,  when i was walking ,  i realized that he &apos;s stuck in that limo all the time .  he &apos;s stuck with his interviews ,  he &apos;s stuck with his autograph ,  he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do ,  you know ?  he &apos;s not free .  he &apos;s just part of the machine ,  and if you think about it ,  freedom &apos;s all that there really is . 
uh - huh .

yeah ,  we all want to see him .  so when &apos;s he coming ? 
guy should cut down on his caffeine intake .

i &apos;d like to . 
i mean ,  what is there to be happy about really ?  i mean ,  going to the gym ,  climbing the stairmaster ,  eating the yogurt ,  checking the voice mail .  smoking the low - tar cigarettes ,  shaving the bikini line .  sometimes i just want something different ,  you know ? 
mm - hm .  i &apos;m a big girl .  i can take care of myself .  if i didn &apos;t want to be here ,  i &apos;d be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for chinese food .

all my things ?  all the eighteen suits ,  all the custom - made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts ,  and the cuff - links and the platinum key -  chains ,  and the cigarette cases ?

if we wait until we understand everything we &apos;ll be dead .  come on .  you can learn more from one kiss than from years in school .

you better have a pretty good explanation for this ,  selena . 
that was meant for me ! 
but it &apos;s impossible . 
i heard my mother ask you once  &quot; how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty ?  &quot;  she was wrong ,  zaltar ,  you have a generous heart . 
you can use the wand . 
tuesday . 
here i am ,  honey ,  and i &apos;m all yours .   remember when you were queen of the prom ?  all the guys had to wait in line to get a dance .   but now there &apos;s only one name on your dance card ,  sweet thing ,  and it &apos;s  -  -

hi .  mister kent .   guess who mom &apos;s having dinner with tonight ?  superman ! 
anyway ,  the reunion &apos;s just the hook for the story .  what it &apos;s really about is how the typical small town &apos;s changed in the last fifteen years .  how do you like this a title :  can you go home again  ? 
it &apos;s practically an american ritual ,  mr .  white !  isn &apos;t that so ,  jimmy ? 
ah yes ,  august gorman .  have you looked for work this week ,  mr .  gorman ? 
the only other employment you found was in a fast - food joint -  -    -  -  which lasted .   .   .  28 minutes !  well !  that &apos;s some kind of record .  talk about fast ! 
mr .  gorman ,  the city of metropolis is generous to a fault ,  but .   .   .

it is kinda romantic . 
yeah ,  thanks .   .   .   .  i mean ,  really !  posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in niagara falls .   i mean ,  .  imagine wasting a great reporter  -    -  -  uh ,  reporters  -  -  on this .   perry white and his sunday magazine exposes . 
i &apos;m in love with you .  how do you feel ? 
you did it .  you gave it all up for me .  i  .   .   .  i don &apos;t know what to say .

i &apos;ll try to remember that  .   .   . 
a good time !  is that all you care about ?  ! 
well done ,  miss teschmacher . 
no ,  me ,  me ,  me .  thank you . 
you no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest .   surely this is not how you repay their gratitude ,  kal - el .  could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream . 
you have been given a higher form of happiness .  the happiness you feel by serving others ,  by inspiring them to  -  - 
 -  -  as the keeper of the archives of krypton ,  it falls to me to tell you of the darkest episode in our planets history . 
don &apos;t feel bad ,  mr .  luthor .  it almost worked .  i mean california almost threw up right in the ocean .  millions of people almost killed .  if it hadn &apos;t been for that guy superman  -  that overgrown boyscout .  .  . 
where ? 
oh my fullness ,  as i explained to you before ,  i am about the best there is .  second best there is . 
superman !  the  -  - 
wait !  don &apos;t go in !  it &apos;s a trap ! 
why do you say this to me when you know i will kill you for it ? 
no drinks  .  no movie .  this is the last time i take a charter flight . 
who is this imbecile ?  where is he ? 
you are master of all you survey . 
it &apos;s brilliant .  daddy thinks so ,  too .  you &apos;ll write a new series  -  -   &apos;metropolis after hours .  &apos;
i &apos;ve never been in a place like this before . 
oh  .   .   .  no ,  there &apos;s no one back home . 
then prove it .  lois is doing an interview with superman about his peace mission  .   .   . 
i missed you .  it wasn &apos;t any fun up there with just lois and superman .  they &apos;re so boring .  let &apos;s go do something wild ! 
any more like you back home ,  clark ? 
you &apos;ll find a good man lacy .  you deserve one . 
 &apos;are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense ?  &apos;
it &apos;s just a bad flu ,  really .  how did you know  .   .   . 
superman ?  has something happened to him ? 
would you mind waiting for me in the visitor &apos;s gallery ? 
well  .   .   .  i see the ocean currents .   .   .  and the rain  .   .   .  and mountains and rivers .   .   .  but  .   .   . 
not so fast !   all trips are canceled .  we pay for wire services .  and what we don &apos;t get from them ,  we &apos;ll invent . 
but he &apos;s never there . 
whoa .   .   . 
hey ,  uncle lex ,  how &apos;s the nuclear guy goin &apos; to find his way here ? 
you think he &apos;ll find us . 
nifty ,  huh ?   goodnight sweet prince ,  parting is  .   .   .  inevitable  now ,  destroy superman . 
which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun . 
yes ,  so ,  well ,  werner would &apos;ve gotten to that too but   -  -    -  -   but the xk101 flies only eight feet above the ground .  .  . well below the radar limit !   so what ?  we could have done that soon .  we had ways to make people ta -  -  ways to avoid the radar .  and this xk101   -  -  they think it &apos;s so smart that they keep it in  &apos;missile silos &apos; underground .  hah !   we kept many things underground . 
she &apos;s in california .  that &apos;s wild enough ,  i guess . 
clark .  .  . son .  .  . that .  .  . thing you did with the sheriff today .  .  .  those .  .  . stunts .  .  . you don &apos;t do those things at school ,  do you ? 
i talked to ben hubbard this morning .  he &apos;ll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares . 
mother .  .  . 
stop him ,  clark ! 
what now ,  my love ? 
is that what they &apos;re calling him ? 
super .  .  . man .  hmmm .  .  . 
why does it all mean so much to you ?  all the time ,   &apos;land ,  land ,  land .  &apos;
i &apos;m going to bed . 
about vesuvius .  about superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano .   ahh ,  the look on his face when he saw that kryptonite .  when will i see another ,  y &apos;know ?  y &apos;know ? 
you &apos;re not going to hit me ? 
you &apos;ve been under such a strain .  and i &apos;ve  .  .  . i &apos;ve  -  -    -  -  neglected you .  mea culpa !  y &apos;know . 
she knows .  clever ,  very clever .   and unappreciated .  but i &apos;m going to take you away from all this . 
where &apos;s mine ?  !  where &apos;s my parachute ? 
then  - 
two . 
need i ask who &apos;s favored to collect at the end of this week . 
the good lord works in mysterious ways . 
do as i say .  let go ! 
okay .  let &apos;s start with these strange powers of yours . 
do bullets really bounce off you ? 
can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound ? 
i .  .  . uh .  .  . 
i broke the man out of prison  -  - 
cleaning a rock ,  otis ?   jot it down .  as soon as we &apos;re back ,  he feeds the pets . 
sort of . 
what is this ?  ?  ! 
well   -  -   you &apos;ve got me !  what can i say ? 
yes ,  we do know each other .   i &apos;m alison jones . 
i &apos;m glad to hear that zoe &apos;s okay . 
then .  .  . when did she get better ? 
she &apos;s in trouble ? 
say hi to zoe . 
i understand . 
that &apos;s my daughter .   or it may be the police to tell me that they &apos;ve found her dead .   she &apos;s a drug addict . 
it just seems .  .  . kind of weird . 
what do you mean  &apos;outgrown it &apos; ? 
goodnight ,  mr .  ansel . 
well ,  i don &apos;t know why it should .  there &apos;s a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits .   we &apos;re hardly unique here ,  billy .   i mean ,  i can understand how you feel . 
i &apos;ve tried to stay out of it .   but it turns out that &apos;s not so easy ,  sam .   you &apos;ve gone and got yourself this lawyer .   mitchell stephens .  you and risa and wendell and the ottos . 
no ,  billy .   we can &apos;t drop the lawsuit .   you know how much we need the money . 
she said she &apos;s got to be home by nine . 
have you been waiting long ? 
they can look forward to that . 
 .  .  . or that the guardrail wasn &apos;t strong enough . 
those are all from the fair last year .   abbott and me were judges at the pet show . 
from what ? 
you &apos;ve talked to billy ? 
you heard what abbott said ? 
away from your crazy mom . 
i didn &apos;t ask if you wanted milk . 
and winter ? 
from you ? 
is he coming over now ?   right away ? 
what &apos;s vermin again ? 
i want to sit beside you tomorrow . 
there &apos;s no such thing as an accident ,  nicole .   not in a situation like this . 
dolores . 
note my objection .   she said ,   &apos;as i &apos;m talking .  &apos;
when ? 
yes . 
crafts . 
remember that time we were having the car washed and i started playing with the automatic window ?   how old was i ,  daddy ?   five or six ?   i got absolutely soaked ,  remember ? 
i can hear you breathing ,  daddy . 
some more wine ? 
i &apos;m sorry for coming over unannounced like this ,  mrs .  otto ,  but the walkers said you would understand .   i know it &apos;s an awful time ,  but it &apos;s important that we talk . 
i &apos;m a lawyer . 
please ,  let me explain .   i &apos;ll only take a moment of your time . 
dolores ? 
isn &apos;t that what you want us to believe ?   that we &apos;re completely defenseless ?   that you know what &apos;s best ? 
kyle lambston &apos;s a drunk .   nobody likes him .   he &apos;s a nasty piece of work . 
you are ? 
i was scared . 
how fast would you say mrs .  driscoll was going ?   to the best of your recollection ? 
there wasn &apos;t time ? 
you &apos;re going to blow everyone away . 
what &apos;s so funny ? 
do you like the colour ? 
it &apos;s because of the accident ,  nicole .   most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers .   a lot of people .  .  . well ,  people in this town are very angry .  us included . 
you &apos;re going to need special care for a long time to come .   it &apos;s not going to be easy .   not for you ,  not for any of us .   because we love you so much .   and it &apos;s going to cost money .   more than we can imagine . 
what are you up to ,  nicole ? 
you ought to stop this nonsense ,  loretta ,  these two dollar bets . 
where are we running ?   what am i missing here ? 
frank ,  i think maybe you lied to me . 
you told me that your boy was washed up with susie hunsecker ,  didn &apos;t you ? 
i see bartha gave you cold tongue for supper .   hey ,  wait a minute ! 
mr .  hunsecker ,  there &apos;s nothing to that smear .   you have my sincere word .  .  . 
take it easy ,  susie .   he wouldn &apos;t be much of a man if he didn &apos;t understand my concern .   would you ,  son ? 
does he have to be here in our hair ? 
is it news to you ? 
frankly ,  son ,  you lost me on that last hill .   just give us the punch line .  .  . 
i don &apos;t take kindly to you and falco selling me ethics .   who &apos;s the injured party here ,  you ? 
susie ,  as always ,  is free to say anything she thinks .   go on ,  dear ,  say exactly what &apos;s on your mind ,  dear . 
if looks could kill ,  i &apos;m dead .  .  . 
and what have i done to her ,  besides not buy her a new fur coat lately ?   sidney ,  you were right  -  -  the boy &apos;s a dilly . 
i started to say we &apos;re drifting apart .   a year ago ,  in your wildest dreams ,  would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me ?   today i had to call you in ! 
yeah .   at bellevue .   still hanging on .   but they still don &apos;t know if she was pushed . 
you had something to do for me  -  you didn &apos;t do it . 
match me ,  sidney .  .  . 
i &apos;m a schoolboy  -  teach me ,  teach me . 
correct me if i &apos;m wrong ,  but i don &apos;t think so .  .  . 
no ,  lemme finish .   i don &apos;t like this job !   that boy is dumb only on matinee days  -  otherwise he &apos;s got a head .   and susan ,  like you said ,  she &apos;s growing up .   two heads .  what i mean ,  we got a slippery ,  dangerous problem here ! 
i &apos;ll do it ,  j . j .   -  don &apos;t get me wrong  -  in for a penny ,  in for a pound .   i &apos;ll see it through ,  but stop beating me around the head .  let me make a living ! 
i &apos;m not sure i can reach him in time . 
i got that boy coming over here .   what &apos;s so funny ? 
but it &apos;s too late .   i got him back the job .  .  . 
and who &apos;s feet is she on now ? 
well ,  i &apos;ll be darned .   and what does j . j .  think he should do ? 
who put this item in about the comic ?    &quot; if there &apos;s a more hilarious funny man around than herbie temple at the palace ,  you &apos;ll have to pardon us for not catching the name .   we were too busy screaming .  &quot;  does this temple have a press agent ? 
i don &apos;t think so . 
is frank d &apos;angelo around ? 
he was writing a special sunday piece on .  .  .  ? 
and where was his wife ? 
this sort of thing ! 
no ,  an arm ,  he said .   i told him you were sure the item would be in mr .  hunsecker &apos;s column in tomorrow &apos;s .  .  . 
i wish i could help in some way ,  sidney . 
that &apos;s your idea of logic ?   i tell the judge i didn &apos;t murder the man  -  the judge says ,   &quot; why not you ?  &quot; 
dallas ,  ask your own manager  -  he &apos;s standing here like a pained wolfhound  -  hunsecker and elwell are enemies to the knife .   so how do you get him doing j . j .  a favor ? 
you &apos;re talking very fast . 
feels like a monday night ,  don &apos;t it .  .  .  ? 
do you think j . j .  likes steve .  .  .  ? 
listen ,  get a good night &apos;s sleep  -  tomorrow &apos;s another day .   feeling sorry for yourself won &apos;t help . 
and i &apos;m sorry for you ,  too ,  sidney .  you &apos;re going down with the ship . 
i know that bit  -  you &apos;re a girl; you need a man to give you strength !  so what do you pick such weak sisters for ?   don &apos;t you know yet that you fight fire with fire ,  not with tear drops ? 
don &apos;t run away  -  i was always the man for you !   i &apos;m talking to you out of two years of silence  -  listen to what i say !   inside of six months  - 
jimmy ,  i &apos;m on my way inside right now to talk to hunsecker .   i can promise you  - 
no more you don &apos;t !   what is this  -  you &apos;re showing off for her ?   they &apos;re supposed to hear you in korea ? 
this is big ,  you know .   very big !  let &apos;s go out later ,  drink some firewater .   with the boys .   fred can call millie and  - 
steve ,  my brother isn &apos;t as bad as he &apos;s painted .   he isn &apos;t perfect ,  but  - 
steve .  .  . what you tried to do today .  .  . you tried to take me up on a high mountain .  .  . i couldn &apos;t go all the way .  .  . i failed you .  .  .   will you forgive me ?   have i lost you ,  steve ?   have i .  .  .  ? 
i can &apos;t
now don &apos;t take this the wrong way ,  but you are a terminator ,  right ? 
can i stop by my house ? 
you sure ? 
i need a minute here ,  okay ?   you &apos;re telling me it can imitate anything it touches ? 
you have to do what i say ?  ! 
does it hurt ? 
torque wrench please . 
 &quot; no fate .  &quot;   no fate but what we make .   my father told her this .  .  .  i mean i made him memorize it ,  up in the future ,  as a message to her  -  -  never mind .   okay ,  the whole thing goes  &quot; the future is not set .   there is no fate but what we make for ourselves .  &quot; 
we don &apos;t have much time . 
i know .   this is a dream ,  sarah . 
they took him from me . 
i know ,  but i &apos;m not as strong as i &apos;m supposed to be .   i can &apos;t do it .   i &apos;m screwing up the mission . 
so what do you think ,  doctor ?   i &apos;ve shown a lot of improvement ,  haven &apos;t i ? 
this t - 1000 .  .  .  what happens when you shoot it ? 
basically .   the skynet funding bill is passed .   the system goes on - line august 4th ,  1997 .   human decisions are removed from strategic defense .   skynet begins to learn ,  at a geometric rate .   it becomes self - aware at 2 : 14 a . m .  eastern time ,  august 29 .  in a panic ,  they try to pull the plug . 
is it safe for them here ? 
on august 29th 1997 it &apos;s going to feel pretty fucking real to you ,  too !   anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day ,  get it ? 
that &apos;s because you had a proper upbringing . 
and no elbows on the table ! 
yesterday i read that furtwngler was asked to lead the new york philharmonic back in  &apos;36 ,  toscanini suggested it .  had he accepted ,  he would have become the most celebrated conductor in america . 
i &apos;m very sorry . 
what &apos;s that mean ? 
you bet . 
when you question him again ,  could you treat him with more respect ? 
i &apos;m sorry .  museum ?  not .  .  .  i said orchestra .  sorry .  believe me .   help me ,  steve .  you say you answer for someone from high up .  i ,  too ,  have orders from high up .  very high up .  we want furtwngler .  i &apos;ll give you in return the whole orchestra ,  four ,  five conductors .  i need him ,  steve . 
you do shorthand and typing ? 
steve . 
mine &apos;s the eleventh . 
i &apos;m sorry . 
i have been questioned by the gestapo just like that .  just like you questioned him . 
i want you to understand why you &apos;re here .  you &apos;re automatically banned from public life under control council directive no 24 .  we &apos;re here to look into your case before you appear in front of the tribunal for artists of the denazification commission .  you understand that ? 
what about vice - president of the chamber of music ,  you used that title didn &apos;t you ?  but then i suppose you had no choice there either ,  because i suppose dr .  goebbels just sent you a telegram saying ,  dear mr .  vice - president . 
i keep hearing you helped a lot of jews to escape .  how did you do that ? 
or maybe you called goebbels or goering ?  you were so close you were in the same shithouse as them . 
why were they going to arrest you ? 
who warned you ? 
then you are wrong . 
have no idea what ordinary people thought . 
von der null ? 
that &apos;s an outrageous lie ! 
well .  once he said he &apos;d read what this man wrote about me . 
please stop playing these games with me .  why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding . 
helmuth alfred rode .  second violinist since 1935 .  what &apos;s it mean ,  second violinist ? 
oh ,  we didn &apos;t play for his birthday ,  we played the evening before  -  it was the 19th of april not the 20th . 
guess what i am holding in my hand .  you like guessing games ? 
it &apos;s dr .  furtwngler &apos;s baton ,  which i stole . 
yeah ,  show me ,  i want to see you do it .  pretend i &apos;m adolf .  you &apos;re the maestro ,  and you have the baton in your right hand ,  but you give me the salute just the same . 
you usually don &apos;t work on sunday ,  major ? 
furtwngler sent hitler a telegram for his birthday . 
so ,  you never heard of him . 
it was hermann goering .  i was told he just made the maestro his privy councillor ,  no questions asked .  although dr .  furtwngler stood up to him .  and to dr .  goebbels . 
yes ,  that &apos;s true ,  but he refused to give the nazi salute .  he kept his baton in his right hand .  in hitler &apos;s presence .  that was a brave act .  .  . 
mission control to chuck ,  come in .  .  . 
aren &apos;t i worth waiting for ? 
anything else ? 
the uzi 9 millimeter . 
alright ,  the beige one . 
not lately .   did you check messages ? 
i &apos;m going to a movie ,  kiddo .  see ya &apos; .   you and matt have a good time . 
you must have a girlfriend . 
but outside ,  it &apos;s living human tissue .   flesh ,  skin ,  hair .  .  . blood .   grown for the cyborgs . 
 -  - everythingis gone .   just gone .   there were survivors .  here .   there .   nobody knew who started it .   it was the machines . 
you cold ? 
we gotta get you to a doctor . 
this is gonna make me puke .  talk about something . 
what &apos;s he like ? 
stop !   i don &apos;t want to know .  hold still .   so .  .  . it was john that ordered you here ? 
i &apos;m sure . 
you &apos;ll learn . 
thanks a lot . 
that &apos;s where we &apos;re going . 
didn &apos;t you say that they &apos;re going to develop this revolutionary new thing .  .  . 
make sure there &apos;s none on the threads ,  like this .   now screw the end - cap on .  .  . very gently . 
hot dogs ? 
kyle ,  the women in your time .  .  . what were they like ? 
what are you doing ? 
sarah . 
surrounded by living tissue . 
why were the other two women killed ? 
yes ,  but i don &apos;t want to leave .   i think this guy &apos;s following me . 
okay ,  let &apos;s see .  .  . got a pos -  itive on her .   she &apos;s sarah connor ,  works as a legal -  - 
that stuff &apos;s two hours cold . 
did you reach the next girl yet ? 
you promised you &apos;d meet projections ,  alan .   a dollar sixty per share you said .   so ,  i don &apos;t think this is so surprising a visit . 
what ? 
it is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father .   or ,  did you think this ,  between us ,  was friendship ?   just because you went fishing with my father ,  i should sit on my hands while you throw my money away ? 
i ,  uh .  .  .  haven &apos;t been to sunday school in years .  .  . 
clean out your locker . 
i apologize ,  sir ,  i &apos;m having a bad day .  .  . 
there &apos;s got to be a flashlight . 
where &apos;d you all go ?   motherfucking frat boys .   you better hide .   is your life so pathetic that this is something you &apos;re willing to pay for ? 
i &apos;ll wait . 
that one did . 
i know the owner of campton place .   i could talk to him in the morning . 
i have a confession to make .   someone gave me six - hundred dollars to spill drinks on you ,  as a practical joke . 
what is it ? 
okay . 
i &apos;m tired .   i &apos;m sorry ,  i should go .  i &apos;ve been enough of a nuisance .

all i mean is .  .  .  someone like you .  .  . 
get us out of here .  .  . 
it could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank .

yes .   i feel realy rested ,  too .  theo ? 
is it over ? 
why ? 
well ,  it wasn &apos;t me .   mister dudley had to clean it and he knows that he &apos;s in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and .  .  .   you said the good doctor was with you . 
you want to move to new york ,  you want to move in with me ? 
they &apos;re all in here .   all the ones he killed .   they &apos;re just children !  we have to help them ! 
what &apos;d you come back for ,  babe ? 
am i a thing ? 
i don &apos;t like do - it - yourself cuisine .  buffets .   salad bars . 
italian ? 
hey ,  i thought you weren &apos;t a buffet person . 
i &apos;ve lived in l . a .  all my life ,  i &apos;ve never done this drive .

i can &apos;t believe jenny told you all that .  about me .   she was always so embarrassed . 
when did you get in ? 
in what capacity are you employed by this mr .  lindgren ? 
are you serious . 
you don &apos;t believe it was a car accident . 
what did you do ?   to make them take the early 70 &apos;s away from you . 
from pursuing your chosen profession . 
who remembers . 
you have< / u> been away .   or is all this just new to you ? 
 -  -  they want southern ,  i do southern ,  they want midwest ,  i do midwest ,  they want tall ,  blonde ,  and twenty - two ,  i &apos;m shit out of luck .   one thing i can &apos;t do is english .  americans can &apos;t .   shouldn &apos;t even try .  and laurence olivier couldn &apos;t do us . 
not that i recall . 
minor officials bother you ,  don &apos;t they ?

ann -  - 
he was deaf when he wrote this . 
sure .  .  .  sure ,  it &apos;s his house . 
i have to do it .  i can &apos;t stand by and watch more things go down the drain .  you &apos;re young ,  you don &apos;t understand . 
but more or less . 
it doesn &apos;t matter ,  mr crane . 
well ,  it &apos;s the wildest goose there is .  risk money .  very speculative .  except ,  ed ,  in certain situations ,  it &apos;s not ,  see ?  i thought i had a prospect here .  well ,  i make the haul up and this lousy so - and - so tells me his situation has changed -  - all his capital &apos;s gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own .  thank you ,  mother !  pop goes another bubble !  it &apos;s only the biggest business opportunity since henry ford and i can &apos;t seem to interest a soul ! 
come in ,  come in ,  siddown over there .  coffee ? 
 .  .  . it just goes to show ,  when one door slams shut ,  another one opens .  here &apos;s to ya ,  uh .  .  .

 .  .  . oh ,  jesus . 
where you going ? 
 .  .  . what a knucklehead . 
 &apos;gratulations ,  gina .  it &apos;s so goddamn wonderful .

 .  .  . i don &apos;t get it . 
yeah . 
 .  .  . did big dave mention that it was something about his war service ?  i don &apos;t know ,  i wasn &apos;t there ,  *you &apos;ll* have to tell *us* .  maybe he specified ,  maybe he didn &apos;t; i &apos;m not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar ,  this cynical manipulator ,  this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores ,  and who made a fool out of this entire town ,  turns to *you* to help him out of his jam .  fat - assed sonofabitch ! 
no thanks . 
bert &apos;s ok ,  sure ,  he &apos;s a good man .  i won &apos;t kid you though ,  ed ,  nobody around here has any experience with this kind of ,  er .  .  .  and i hear they &apos;re bringing a prosecutor up from sacramento .  capital offense .  taking it seriously .  .  .  hmm .  .  . 
 .  .  . probity . 
 .  .  . i &apos;m rachel abundas .  everyone calls me birdy . 
 .  .  . ed ? 
jesus .  .  . 
 .  .  . you sure ,  eddie ? 
frank . 
no ,  i mean it &apos;s growing ,  it &apos;s part of us .  and we cut it off .  and throw it away . 
just people .  they gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money .  this is why the big lobby ,  ed .  but they put their pants on one leg at a time .  just like you and me . 
barber ,  right ?  i &apos;m freddy riedenschneider .  hungry ?  they tell me the chow &apos;s ok here .  i made some inquiries . 
 .  .  . yeah ,  it &apos;s a tough break . 
someone broke into this room . 
my office is on the third floor !  there &apos;s a walk - in safe and a portable phone !   we can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help ! 
i had no idea the museum had a complete collection of piranesi &apos;s forum sketches . 
yes . 
forget it ! 
i told you !   they seal off all the cells .   they were designed to fall automatically in a system failure  -  - 
careful .   that mess on the ground is brains . 
this place is a maze . 
dr .  green has to see you ! 
it &apos;s still back there ! 
what &apos;s that ? 
we &apos;ve met .   the hacksaw murders .    &apos;89 . 
this isn &apos;t a death sentence .   greg has promised to teach me fly fishing .   i &apos;ll garden .   i &apos;ll write . 
look at this .   an ambyloid reovirus protein .   that explains why the computer &apos;s confused .   the plant &apos;s infected with a virus . 
 &quot; nocturnal .   external hair and bony plates .   locomotor speed 60 - 70 kilometers .   reduced optic chiasm &quot;  .  .  .  poor eyesight .    &quot; external mucoid nasal glands ,  &quot;  .  .  .  very keen scent .  .  .   &quot; morphological characteristics :  highly robust .   aggressiveness :  extreme .  &quot; 
and it &apos;s hungry .   it &apos;s been two days since it &apos;s eaten .   there are five hundred people arriving right now .  the animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell !   all those people in one enclosed space .  .  . 
what &apos;s going on ? 
what &apos;s that ? 
none of that matters now .   the people upstairs need us .   we have to help . 
do you mean dr .  whittlesley ? 
you said john whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum . 
are there any hidden rooms or staircases ?   places where someone could hide ? 
what do you do ? 
we &apos;re not supposed to go back there . 
stop ! 
argo !   hobbes ! 
is dr .  frock safe ! 
not today .   besides ,  i think the director of the museum is expecting you . 
disappeared .   his body wasn &apos;t among the victims . 
that was two years ago .   john was still in love with me .   he wouldn &apos;t leave me alone . 
no .   i &apos;m all right .   i won &apos;t let this affect me anymore .   john wouldn &apos;t get help .   his ego endangered the lives of others .   his theory came first . 
i don &apos;t understand . 
where would we find it ? 
it &apos;s okay ,  i &apos;m all right .   i remember now .  .  .  it was an animal .   something large !   i could smell it .   it was hunting me .   i saw two green eyes in the dark . 
dr .  green .  .  . 
what was it ? 
help someone ! 
you want to book the flight ? 
what happened down there ? 
give me a shot from truman &apos;s ring . 
i &apos;m sure we &apos;ll get him on this next sweep . 
of course ,  there hasn &apos;t been anything to compare with this  -  the first time an intruder has been a former cast member -  - 
how do< / i> you intend to explain his twenty -  two year absence ? 
but recent events have been so dramatic ,  it does raise the perennial question .  what keeps us watching this one man twenty - four hours a day  -  eating ,  sleeping ,  working ,  sitting for hours in contemplation ? 
we &apos;ve become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions ,  bored with pyrotechnics and special effects .   while the world he inhabits is counterfeit ,  there &apos;s nothing fake about truman himself .   no scripts ,  no cue cards .   it &apos;s not always shakespeare but it &apos;s genuine .   that &apos;s how he can support an entire channel . 
there &apos;s nothing on the show i don &apos;t use myself . 
you really think it could &apos;ve dropped off an airliner ? 
i &apos;m onto something ,  marlon  -  something big . 
could be .   beard looks phony .   it &apos;s when i &apos;m unpredictable .   they can &apos;t stand that .   that &apos;s why we &apos;ve got to get out of here .   can you come with me ? 
what &apos;re we doing here ,  truman ? 
that &apos;s the  &quot; big guy &quot;  .   quite a paintbrush he &apos;s got . 
and the last thing i &apos;d ever do is lie to you .   think about it ,  truman ,  if everybody &apos;s in on it ,  i &apos;d have to be in on it too .  i &apos;m not in on it ,  because there is no it . < / i>
what did you want ? 
come on ,  truman .   haven &apos;t you studied enough ? 
i &apos;ll take you home ,  angela .   why don &apos;t you leave those with us for a while ? 
let me out ,  truman .   you &apos;re not right in the head .   you want to destroy yourself ,  you do it on your own ! 
what the hell has that got to do with anything ?   tell me what &apos;s happening ?  ! 
who were you talking to ?  ! 
how are you ,  mother ? 
how &apos;s it going ,  truman ? 
good .   good . 
well ,  we &apos;re fbi agents . 
special agent scully  -  - 
you &apos;ve been back to dallas ? 
are you going to let us in on what exactly you &apos;re trying to prove  -  - 
what is it you find incredible ? 
no ,  they don &apos;t . 
this man &apos;s still alive . 
who called this meeting ? 
i &apos;m looking for anything out of the ordinary .  maybe something from the fema offices where the bodies were found . 
was there anything in those offices that didn &apos;t go to d . c .  ? 
have you examined them ? 
you follow me out here for a reason ? 
my name &apos;s kurtzweil .  dr .  alvin kurtzweil . 
you a reporter ? 
who sent you ? 
negotiating with whom ? 
you found something ? 
mulder .  .  .  ? 
jesus ,  mulder .  .  . 
you &apos;ve got to quit looking for what isn &apos;t there .  they &apos;ve closed the x - files .  there &apos;s procedure to be followed here .  protocol . 
had you . 
i saw your face ,  mulder .  there was a moment of panic . 
what ?  what are you talking about ? 
go home ,  mulder .  it &apos;s late . 
what did you find ? 
ground &apos;s dry about an inch down .  somebody just laid this down .  very recently ,  i &apos;d say . 
unmarked tanker trucks .  .  .  what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks ? 
we &apos;re not chasing trucks ,  we &apos;re chasing evidence  -  - 
it may be extraterrestrial . 
scully .  .  .  .  ? 
what ?  what &apos;s wrong ? 
i can &apos;t go any farther . 
we &apos;re going to the morgue . 
general mcaddie is who requested our coming here .  we were awakened at three am and told to get down here immediately . 
sit down ,  they &apos;re still talking to agent scully . 
she &apos;s in there right now saying the same thing about you . 
agent mulder  -  - 
are we being watched ? 
where &apos;s scully ? 
a virus ? 
let me out .  stop the car . 
find agent scully .  save her .  only her science can save the future . 
more concerns than that ? 
we &apos;ve allowed this man his freedom .  his books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial .  has he outlived his usefulness to us ? 
you can &apos;t kill mulder .  he &apos;s got too much light on him . 
 &quot; mocky - lock is the bogeyman ,  mocky - lock wants me where i am .  &quot; 
she adores you . 
we &apos;ve been over this a dozen times .   no . 
like a new year &apos;s day hangover . 
i refilled the zyprexa and atavan .  .  . 
i &apos;ll come by tomorrow after work .   with dinner . 
this man is deeply disturbed ,  he .  .  . 
edward baines ,  i presume .   hi ,  ed .   i &apos;m pete . 
why &apos;d you bring him here ? 
you liked him ? 
oh no .  .  .  no you don &apos;t . 
catherine ! 
into stargher .   inside .  .  . 
nervous ? 
you sure you want to go through with this ? 
ich weiss nicht . 
but i could follow it fine .  perhaps harry told you about me .  my name &apos;s holly martins . 
no . 
dr .  winkel ?  who is he ? 
yes .  they said it wasn &apos;t the driver &apos;s fault .  harry often said what a careful driver he was . 
oh ,  what was the name of that doctor ?  harry &apos;s doctor ? 
can i hear you ? 
 .  .  . to steal my girl . 
let &apos;s go away . 
let &apos;s not get into any more trouble . 
i wish i knew . 
i &apos;m going back home . 
he &apos;s better dead .  i know he was mixed up  -  but not like that . 
are you going ,  too ? 
how do you know ? 
good evening ,  miss schmidt .  you remember me ? 
cigarette ,  miss schmidt ? 
right .  sit down miss schmidt ,  we will send your letters and things back to you . 
joseph harbin .  .  . 
in one of his letters he asked you to telephone  -  a good friend of his called joseph .  he gave you the number of the casanova club .  that is where a lot of friends of lime used to go . 
now then ,  miss schmidt ,  i &apos;m not interested in your forged papers  -  that &apos;s purely a russian case .  when did you last see lime ? 
i want the truth ,  miss schmidt .  we know he is alive . 
joseph harbin &apos;s body was found in the coffin . 
here we are .  you &apos;ll be all right here ,  miss . 
how will i know you ? 
please keep this passport to yourself ,  until i make some inquiries ,  will you ,  major ? 
did you ever hear of  &quot; the lone rider of santa fe ?  &quot; 
 &quot; death at the double x ranch &quot;   -  ra -  a - nch . 
 .  .  . a cop .  you &apos;re a real cop i suppose . 
tactful too ,  aren &apos;t we ,  callaghan ? 
 .  .  . in the morning . 
i tell you i heard him running ahead of me . 
it wouldn &apos;t work . 
didn &apos;t i ? 
do you mind if i drop off somewhere on the way ?  i &apos;ve got an appointment ,  won &apos;t take five minutes .  .  . 
write her out a receipt ,  paine .  give her a receipt for these letters too . 
very good ,  sir . 
get me major callaghan on the phone . 
you do ! 
oh ,  mr .  martins ,  good evening . 
what &apos;s that ? 
listen .  .  . 
listen ,  harry  -  i didn &apos;t believe that .  .  . 
did the police believe you ? 
well ,  i &apos;ve got quite a lot on my mind . 
i &apos;m only safe in the russian zone .  .  .  i &apos;m safe as long as they can use me .  .  . 
 .  .  . this way . 
mr .  martins .  delighted to meet you .  come let &apos;s sit down here .  ober !  zwei .  what would you like .  tea ?  coffee ? 
mr .  popescu  -  mr .  martins . 
are you mad ? 
did you know mr .  lime well ? 
 .  .  . popescu .  .  . 
sehen sie da gleich da unter .  da unten ist est passiert .  passiert  -  english . 
could he have been conscious ? 
third man . 
what are you doing in thailand ?  tourist ? 
you go to patpong ?  see smoke from pussy ,  ping pong ball from pussy ,  razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy . 
oh .  great .  not far at all .  i don &apos;t like to be negative ,  but do you think we should let someone know where we &apos;re going ? 
we think in miles ,  not kilometers . 
well to be honest ,  etienne ,  i would rather have not known about it . 
what about moliere ? 
he said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach . 
exactly . 
no one follows that midrash . 
watch your language .  .  .  . 
whereas avi &apos;s a zionist nazi . 
read the early zionists on european jewry; they sound like goebbels . 
that was an ark ,  man .  that was a torah .  they fucked around with it ,  and the torah melted their faces . 
what ,  do you like it here ? 
where did you read this ?  robert faurisson ? 
it &apos;s called the flame alphabet .  it &apos;s supposed to be the word of god written in fire . 
fuck you .  i hate the jews at least as much as you do . 
fifty &apos;s an exaggeration .  anyway ,  that was a different moment .  things were possible that aren &apos;t now . 
no ,  they don &apos;t .  not the smart ones .   look ,  i &apos;ll give you five grand if you can document your tax - exempt status .  .  .  .  but when you fall off this horse ,  come see me .  i can show you how to make a lot of money . 
you think people ever commit suicide out of happiness ? 
i bet .  he didn &apos;t realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one . 
bigger and better . 
where &apos;d you get this ? 
va - yomer .  .  .  and he said .   it goes the other way . 
the sex is better . 
v &apos;asitem lechem pessel to - monat .  and make no graven image of the lord ,  or the form of any figure ,  or of man or woman ,  or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything .  because he &apos;s not like anything .  not only can &apos;t you see him or hear him ,  you can &apos;t even think about him .  i mean ,  what &apos;s the difference between that and him not existing ? 
fuck that . 
i don &apos;t know .  i just want to try it . 
miriam called ,  looking for you .  she said you might come ,  so i .  .  . 
danny ,  the night we met ,  you said the name ilio manzetti .  we were impressed .  we were excited .  but here it is september ,  and mr .  manzetti is still walking around breathing the air . 
more cultural than political . 
but when it comes out ,  the public will be outraged .  it will look like germany all over again . 
we want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream :  works like the bell curve< / i> ,  sociobiology< / i> ,  anti - zionism ,  anti -  immigration ,  the com - munitarian issue .  .  .  .  we &apos;ll hold conferences :  invite liberals ,  blacks ,  jews .  chomsky ,  cockburn ,  stanley crouch ,  shahack .  .  .  . 
jewish girls like to give head ,  right ? 
notice the israelis :  a fundamentally secular society .  they no longer need judaism because they have soil .  the real jew is a wanderer ,  a nomad .  he has no roots ,  no attachments .  so he  &quot; universalizes &quot;  everything .  he can &apos;t hammer a nail ,  plow a field .  he can only buy and sell ,  invest capital ,  manipulate markets .  he takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books ,  ideas ,  numbers .  this is his strength .  .  .  .   take the great jewish minds :  marx ,  freud ,  einstein .  what have they given us :  communism ,  infantile sexuality and the atom bomb .  in a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of europe ,  they &apos;ve taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare ,  irrational urges and relativity ,  a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt .  why ?  because it is the deepest impulse of the jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread ,  nothing but nothingness .  nothingness without end .  .  . 
what ?  excuse me ?  .  .  .   you &apos;re kidding ,  right ? 
did you kill ilio manzetti ? 
explain it so i can . 
no ! 
what about chicken ? 
but it &apos;s stupid ,  right ?  you admit it &apos;s stupid . 
tell it to hitler . 
is this because of those kids who used to beat you up ? 
hello .  .  .  ? 
get out of here .  .  .  . 
what is it ? 
this will be a different kind of device . 
mrs .  moebius . 
when do you want it to go off ? 
jeez ,  it &apos;s been since ,  what ,  kenny &apos;s wedding . 
danny ,  listen ,  people expect me to daven; they don &apos;t want someone they don &apos;t know  -  -  leading their prayers . 
shoot him in the head .  always shoot a jew in the head . 
where do you think you &apos;re going ? 
are you out of your mind ?  ! 
i think ,  he &apos;s really nice .  .  .  he &apos;s a funny guy .  .  .  sometimes even very moving . 
are you going to keep it ? 
maybe you should talk to him about it . 
johana ,  am i boring you ? 
did the driver really freeze ? 
listen ,  i just found out we &apos;ve got real problems in sicily ! 
i might have known .   as i was telling you earlier ,  i &apos;m the world champion free diver . 
he looks strange ,  doesn &apos;t he ?  like a baby that just learned to walk . 
because you &apos;d laugh . 
how do you know that ? 
five minutes and fifty seconds . 
santini will do that for 25 dollars ! 
it isn &apos;t lit yet . 
listen we &apos;re not supposed to piss either but that doesn &apos;t stop you from carrying  &quot; it &quot;  on board ?  ! 
and .  .  .  does the voice come back ? 
well ,  if it isn &apos;t the little frenchman !   how is the little frenchman ? 
that &apos;s good . 
enzo ? 
madame .  .  . 
today at lunch ,  you asked me if i had any questions . 
here .  .  .   here .  .  . 
you &apos;d rather think about it and make yourself miserable ? 
i give you this .   you &apos;re stubborn .  .  .  dumb ,  but stubborn . 
enzo ,  enzo !   congratulations ! 
yes .  .  .  maybe .  .  .  i don &apos;t know .   i don &apos;t like competitions .  .  .  it ruins the fun .   don &apos;t you think ? 
you jumped in ? 
then ,  tell me a story . 
hello ? 
what ? 
did you buy the cassettes ?   the wagner ,  the berlioz ? 
uncle louis ,  you remember enzo &apos;s mother signora molinari from amorgos ? 
well ? 
how was your trip ? 
if there was a problem ,  they could do something right ? 
what &apos;s that little air bottle on the machine ? 
i &apos;ll go see how he &apos;s doing . 
your mother ?  oh .  whoops . 
want to get a drink ? 
i want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons .  little abraham will go to stanford for college ,  batya will go ivy league ,  maybe vassar . 
also ,  on a daily basis ,  i want you to tell me what to do ,  where to do it ,  and how i should live my life . 
esther ! 
you two know each other ? 
let &apos;s let your tuchus breathe . 
 .  .  . and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels ,  and light the menorah with the knowl .  .  . 
but we &apos;re not open on sundays . 
so morde - chai ,  tell me ,  what brings your bad self down to the klf ? 
how do we bypass it ? 
what should i charge ? 
well ,  he &apos;s kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend . 
maybe i should just forget all about money  -   -  forget about mamma and the kids and the rent ,  huh  -  marry some poor dope like  -  -  oh ,  like carlos dominguez  -   -  and get fat and  - 
sure ! 
what &apos;s left of him . 
) they buried teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again  -  -  out in the country this time .  but they didn &apos;t get him . 
don &apos;t look at it ! 
the death card  -   - 
it may sound like music to her  -  -  i can do better with my teeth in a cold shower .   click  click  click . 
i mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl . 
and if you &apos;ve got cold feet honey ,  ill take over for you .  that red dress of yours fits just perfect on me . 
well ,  i &apos;d best be off . 
but it doesn &apos;t eat what it kills . 
charlie and i were talking .  that &apos;s one reason i wanted to see you . 
it could be a man . 
there are all sorts of men .  you get to see some funny ones as a reporter . 
yes .  there have been men who kill for pleasure  -  -  strange pleasure .  there was blue beard in france  -  -  jack the ripper in london .  it &apos;s not uncommon . 
consuelo screamed too  -  -  and clo clo .  why did you do it ?  why ?  quick .  tell me why ? 
well ,  i &apos;m next .  you won &apos;t hear anything like that ,  mr .  galbraith .   i &apos;m not a popular favorite since i let the leopard loose . 
yes ,  there is something wrong .  people who want publicity and don &apos;t mind how they get it  -  - what risks they make other people run  -   -  what agony and sorrow they bring to other people  -  - 
that &apos;s a fact ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
that &apos;s easy .  me . 
get it out of here ! 
on his back ,  i suppose . 
i suppose he was trying to make me feel bad . 
well ,  does everybody love us now ?  you &apos;ve been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors ! 
 as long as my feet held out . 
why do you want to stay around here ?  it &apos;ll only make you feel badly . 
all right ,  i &apos;m not ashamed of it !  i split it two ways 
kiki ? 
we stood here once before . 
i hated you that day  -  you and your flip talk  -  with that little girl lying dead . 
jerry ,  i want you to be soft .  you are soft  -  -  inside  -  where it matters .  i wanted it that day too ,  but didn &apos;t dare tell you . 
nobody ?  huh !  .  .  .  how come ? 
de moraes ?  i was asked here by a mrs spitz . 
good afternoon .  de moraess residence . 
im afraid they are out at the moment ,  sir . 
by the way ,  laurence ,  were you here last time your mistresss brother came over ?  you know ,  just before he disappeared ? 
mrs de moraes must have taken it hard ,  eh ?   her brothers death . 
is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan ? 
its a snuff movie .  prime paedophile material .  im told it retails at around 4 , 000 .   i see you dont require a definition . 
your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place ,  mrs de moraes .  and having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise .   you dont mess around with child procurers .  right now my guess is hes either on the run ,  held captive ,  or dead .   i understand your misgivings ,  mrs de moraes .  but ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man leon bought him from .  if anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man .  which leads me to why im here at such a late hour .  i need 20 , 000 ,  in cash ,  by 11 this morning . 
how dare you .  .  .   you dont know this tape belongs to my brother ,  do you ,  mr lombard ? 
the family hired you and i have just fired you ,  mr lombard . 
huh !  who do you think we are ,  mr lombard ? 
are we understood ? 
you know hed have had him killed ,  dont you ?  does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind ,  deborah ?  or is it just cold expediency ?  could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married ? 
does the name pierre dreyer mean anything to you ?  hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband . 
adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in epping forest ,  didnt he ?  seemed like a good idea .  an ex - junkie ,  obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide .  he just forgot one thing :  forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery english november .  an englishman might have thought of that ,  but a brazilian .  .  . 
leons not found ,  your parents worry ,  talk of hiring help to find him ,  even mention their manhunter friends perhaps .  .  .  and adonis panics ,  takes control ,  brings me in reckoning a small -  time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward ,  not before leons found anyhow .  he must have kicked himself when he learned id exceeded his expectations . 
i doubt friedman ever even met leon ,  deborah .  friedman dealt with select customers .  as for my envelope ,  had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called lamont when we met in los angeles . 
and you still havent told me why you sent me after friedman . 
a fright ?  .  .  .  five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright ? 
dont you believe in simplicity ? 
crow what ? 
may i ask where youre from ,  mr lamont ? 
a recent acquisition .  weve had four break -  ins this year alone; files stolen ,  computers wrecked ,  faeces smeared on walls .  the good guys dismiss us as alarmist do - gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us .  an easy living indeed ,  mr lombard .   i got through to moreau and jane .  i left your landlord out of it .  your flats been broken into .  jane wants you to call her back . 
some italian i picked up back there .  hes in the boot of the mustang . 
theyd never let me go .  and youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me . 
nothing sticks to slime ,  emily .   this should cover what you lent me . 
fifteen for a straight delivery .  twenty with the provision of a safe place .  visitors tend to find the second option more convenient . 
ever seen him before ? 
how many of you scumbags are here ? 
the hyatt .  good afternoon .  may i help you ? 
oh .  .  .  we split up . 
ive got work tonight ,  jane . 
no .  .  .  i told you on the phone .  whoever broke in messed - up all your papers .  i put everything back where i thought it ought to be .   maybe its there with .  .  . 
lombard ,  this is not a jewish name ,  is it ? 
you may not .  and besides ,  it is irrelevant . 
good .  now ,  as i trust you may have guessed ,  we are looking for someone to work for us .  someone whose discretion can be relied upon .  someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment .  do you think you could be that person ,  mr lombard ? 
the rooms yours for 24 hours .  its sound -  proofed ,  stocked up with food ,  drink and other things you might find useful .  you can do anything you like . 
vous tes franais ? 
lets go . 
is it real ?   you people are sick . 
the hyatt .  .  .  ?  whats that ? 
the person who put us in touch seems to think so . 
your lady friend did . 
an austrian .  .  .  not much to go on ,  is it ? 
its wet .  will this do ? 
is this some kind of mugging ?  because .  .  . 
in my jacket .  left inside pocket . 
a private investigator .  .  .  youre not austrian ? 
whats a french private investigator doing here ? 
theyre german jews .  came here before the war .  they both lost all their families in extermination camps ,  but they themselves never went near one .  the idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting leon .  its not guilt ,  more of a curse .  .  .   and then theres something about his parents being involved with nazi hunters .  .  .  but i think thats just one of leons dark delusions .  .  . 
the money leon left for the boy ,  was it cash ? 
and you aint neither one of those damned mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped - off by their friendly cross -  border guides ,  are you ,  mister ? 
quest - ce que tu veux ? 
we are so alike ,  xavier .  still ,  sometimes i wonder which one of us is the ugliest . 
five seconds .  then you die . 
so you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room .  .  .  how did friedman say he got to know where to find me ? 
what do you think ? 
oh dear ,  why is life so complicated ?  sometimes i really wish i could be someone else . 
what do you mean ? 
jeanne ,  this is  -  -  in fact  -  -  my loyal friend and finest archer ,  jean d &apos;aulon .   jean .  .  .  i place her in your care .   find her suitable lodgings  -  -  here  -  -  in the castle .  .  .  and guard her with your life . 
my dear aulon .  .  .   that &apos;s fine .  .  . 
jeanne ,  stop it ! 
what &apos;s going on ?  ! 
the king said you &apos;re his finest archer .  .  .  ? 
jeanne ,  calm down ,  do you hear me ?  are you alright ? 
they &apos;ve abandoned me .  .  .  like everyone . 
all you have to do is stop talking and just listen . 
that &apos;s not what i asked .  .  .  why do you want to marry me ? 
it &apos;s a trap !   they &apos;re buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from england ! 
i am ready now .  .  . 
i &apos;m already free .  .  . 
we have to press home the attack ! 
and didn &apos;t you order the citizens of paris to surrender the city in the name of the king of heaven ? 
but if this trial seems fixed ,  i fear you &apos;ll have the very opposite result to the one you want .  .  . 
trial ?   what trial ?  ? 
the english ?  ? 
jeanne ,  listen to me very carefully .  we are all men of faith ,  and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own .   we do so in the name of our holy mother church ,  who never closes her arms to those who would return to her .   but we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority .   take heed of this charitable admonition ,  for if you persist in refusing our help ,  then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers ,  and i think you know well enough the punishment that would await you .   so now .  .  .  will you please recite our lord &apos;s prayer ? 
jeanne  -  -  be careful  -  -  you &apos;re not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment .  .  . 
jeanne ,  you are not helping yourself .   if you don &apos;t answer our questions properly ,  your refusal will be taken into account . 
i don &apos;t understand ,  jeanne .  .  .  why did you do it ?   why ? 
there &apos;s no need to be afraid ,  sire . 
 .  .  .  and what .  .  .  what did he say ? 
so how would you put it ? 
your majesty ,  i urge you not to see this woman .   it all reeks of a burgundian trap ! 
my captains have sworn their support . 
does he have hair ? 
5 , 000 gold crowns . 
good .   where are the english ? 
what &apos;s going on ? 
brilliant idea .  .  .  but to be really effective ,  why not send a whole army of virgins ? 
jeanne .  .  .  let him do it .   one more dead body &apos;s not going to make any difference ,  so who cares ? 
jeanne .  .  .  the men are exhausted ! 
jeanne .  .  .  we &apos;re not enough .  .  . 
so you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man ? 
but will you also submit to the decision of the church ? 
do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin ?   no one is allowed to destroy the life that god created ! 
but you can &apos;t just kill a man for his teeth ! 
so who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river ?  ? 
la hire ,  i &apos;m warning you  -  -  don &apos;t swear ! 
i swear i &apos;ll never swear again in my life if you save her life !   but i &apos;m warning you ,  if you let her die ,  then you &apos;re the biggest .  .  . 
we .  .  .  won ?  ! 
take mine instead  -  -  here  -  -  smash mine first ! 
you don &apos;t believe me anymore ? 
i .  .  .  i &apos;m leaving .  .  .  i can &apos;t take anymore .  .  . 
that &apos;s too easy .   one minute you want to die ,  the next you want to live .  .  .   do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don &apos;t want it anymore ? 
you mean god said ,   &quot; i need you ,  jeanne ?  &quot; 
yes .  .  .  yes !   and now you tell me why god let all these battles happen in the first place .  .  .  if he &apos;s so powerful .  .  .  he said he &apos;s  &quot; the creator of heaven and earth ,  the source of all life .  .  .  &quot;  he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery ?   why didn &apos;t he ? 
no ,  no ,  you did fine .   i &apos;d even say well done .   besides ,  most of the ones you killed probably deserved it ,  don &apos;t you think ? 
i  -  -  i cleaned up my room ,  look .  .  .  and i said my prayers .  .  .  all of them .  .  .  and .  .  . 
you know what you just signed ,  jeanne ?   you just signed away my existence .  .  .  for you i &apos;m a lie ,  an illusion .   you see ?   in the end ,  you were the one who abandoned me .  .  . 
he already did ,  but i want god to forgive me too . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  mr wladek ,  he wants you to stop . 
a beauty .  who is she ? 
i &apos;ve always loved your playing ,  mr .  szpilman . 
how are you doing ? 
must feel better this side of the wall . 
and suppose they take the table away ? 
what &apos;s this about ? 
boys ,  boys .  .  . 
we leave the money and the watch on the table .  and we cover it like this .   in full view .  the germans will search high and low ,  i promise you ,  they &apos;ll never notice it . 
but .  .  . they won &apos;t get all of us .  .  .  we &apos;ll .  .  . it &apos;s too small .  .  . there &apos;s four hundred thousand of us in warsaw ! 
did you beg ,  did you grovel to that piece of shit ,  that cockroach ? 
what did you pay him ? 
ah ,  here .  today &apos;s news from the other side . 
jehuda ,  give me something to do . 
there are notices going up .  the city &apos;s to be cleansed of undesirables . 
rumours ,  rumours ,  you take it all too much to heart ,  wladek . 
i &apos;m not ,  but majorek is . 
jurek ?  wladek szpilman . 
dirty pig ! 
have a favour to ask .  i want to get out of here . 
out of warsaw . 
you don &apos;t remember me ,  mr .  szpilman ? 
you don &apos;t want to worry about that .  my grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice .   in my opinion ,  jaundice is not very serious .  drink up . 
what &apos;s happening ? 
are the russians here ? 
he is quite altered ,  as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him .  well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone . 
what &apos;s he say ? 
good ,  flatish land with reliable water ,  why ?  i don &apos;t have money .  what are you about ? 
well baines the music lover ,  i never would have known .  hidden talents george .

nobody .   i just know what kinda women he likes .   i &apos;m gonna check all the joyhouses till i find him . 
i think i &apos;ll keep that to myself .  which way are the rooms ? 
best we had was cat &apos;s eye in the second at del mar ,  and he was only 5 - 2 .   not many longshots comin &apos; in today . 
you &apos;re crazy carryin &apos; that kinda money in this neighborhood .   no wonder you got hit .

he was a tear - off rat .   he got what he deserved .   no sense helpin &apos; pay his bills . 
we were partners .   if it weren &apos;t for luther i &apos;d still be hustlin &apos; pinball down at gianelli &apos;s .   i don &apos;t need anything more than i got . 
doyle ,  can i see you a minute ?

been a while since i stocked a wire store .   not many mobs playing that anymore . 
you want the stuff tomorrow or don &apos;t ya ?   it &apos;s gonna take hours just to clean it up .   besides ,  gondorff &apos;s still a hot item .   where am i gonna be if he gets hit ? 
we bought ya a tap into moe anenberg &apos;s wire .   he &apos;s got eyes at every track in the country .   you &apos;ll get race results ,  odds ,  scratches ,  pole positions ,  everything; and just as fast as western union gets  &apos;em . 
aw ,  i conned a senator from florida on a stocks deal .   a real lop - ear .  he thought he was gonna take over general electric .   some chantoozie woke him up ,  though ,  and he put the feds on me . 
this isn &apos;t like playin &apos; winos on the street .   you gotta do more than outrun the guy . 
he &apos;s not as tough as he &apos;d like to think . 
and ? 
why didn &apos;t you tell me about snyder before ? 
i better do some packin &apos; .   i &apos;m gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow .

if you help me out ,  i &apos;ll pay ya back the money you owe shaw ,  myself . 
i gotta talk to me partner first .  we can &apos;t afford to expose our game too much . 
look ,  i got nothin &apos; against you ,  but you &apos;re in trouble here .   all you gotta do is tell us when gondorff &apos;s gonna play his chump .  we come in at the sting ,  make the pinch ,  and you walk out free as a bird .   no questions ,  no court appearance ,  nothing . 
will you wait until the chump is played ? 
i mean completely played .   until he &apos;s beat and the score is taken .  you come in before we beat him and i &apos;ll kill him .   you &apos;ll have a tough time explaining that ,  won &apos;t ya . 
we were getting 50 from our guy . 
take it easy .   everything &apos;s all right .   i put it on syphon ,  on the nose . 
what about this rosebreen ? 
all settled ?   grand !   why did your mother ever divorce him ?   he &apos;s swell . 
i can &apos;t help it .   you don &apos;t know .  .  .  .  . 
you &apos;re sweet ,  but the only thing that you can do for me is to go . 
please !   you can &apos;t get mixed up in this . 
this is a pretty dead bunch ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
you took that money from julia &apos;s hand . 
is your father still in there ? 
another martini  -  - 
not that scrawny little .  .  .  .  ?  
yes .   i hated her for coming between my mother and father .   she kept me from seeing my father .   i went down there to ask her where he was .   she wouldn &apos;t tell me ,  and i shot her . 
he can stay home .   please ,  dad ,  won &apos;t you ? 
it &apos;s a secret .   i can &apos;t even tell you ,  my dear .   i &apos;ve got an important idea to work on . 
you can take that out to the car . 
not at all . 
shrapnel ! 
have you got a pistol permit ? 
this gun yours ? 
what about the suicide ? 
for one thing ,  he was too absent -  minded to hold a grudge . 
he &apos;s holding out on you . 
are you kidding ? 
you mean that body -  -  -  -  -  ? 
shut up . 
good morning  -  - 
but he &apos;s interested ! 
and there she was lying dead .   the police said she &apos;d probably been killed about ten minutes before i got there . 
i thought you &apos;d given up that sort of friend . 
i don &apos;t like him . 
that &apos;s a fine thing to throw up to me after all i &apos;ve been to you .  .  .  . 
i &apos;ll give it back to you  .  .  .  .   all i &apos;ve got  .  .  .  . twenty - five thousand .  .  . 
i never had it . 
is there a mr .  macaulay in the house ?   oh ,  it &apos;s you . 
oh ,  he &apos;s sitting up . 
i got word from wynant this morning .  .  . 
one hundred .  .  .   two hundred .  .  .  three .  .  . 
i wish you &apos;d count them .   there &apos;s a thousand dollars there . 
but it must have been wynant .   i should have known if it weren &apos;t his voice . 
i have no right to answer that . 
where &apos;s gilbert ? 
you did .  .  .  where ? 
it isn &apos;t a story  -  it &apos;s true .   i did see wynant .   he &apos;s not dead . 
i gotta talk to you .   i want you to tell me something and i want you to give it to me straight .  get me ? 
what &apos;s that ? 
he &apos;s dragged me into every gin mill on the block . 
where did you get that ? 
good .  i want to talk to you . 
no thanks . 
what are you going to give me ?   i hope i don &apos;t like it . 
nick !   nick !   there &apos;s someone to she you , 
i never saw that before . 
aren &apos;t you hot in that ? 
did i give it to you ? 
the mystery &apos;s all gone .  and i wanted you to find out who did it . 
why don &apos;t you ? 
you bet i wouldn &apos;t . 
how long has he been dead ? 
then he couldn &apos;t have committed those other murders . 
why not ? 
now nick ,  what &apos;s that got to do with it ? 
i wish you &apos;d tell me who . 
if that knife is missing ,  i &apos;ll look for it in your back . 
how did you get in here ? 
i &apos;m sorry .   tanner ,  don &apos;t you want some wine ? 
you his wife ? 
was he a good detective ? 
well ,  congratulations . 
who fired you ? 
well ,  based on my knowledge of the region ,  its culture and her people i would have to say it &apos;s a box . 
what &apos;s it say ? 
this is miles from the battle lines .  they were probably deserters . 
he &apos;s not so -  - 
i don &apos;t want to see people killed any more than you .   but we try to help out we die ,  and all we do is die . 
where &apos;d they go ? 
you got no reason to hit me .   i &apos;m getting tired of you and jaeger pushing me around . 
says he wanted food .   liar .   he wanted the gold . 
you &apos;re out of your mind . 
then step aside . 
i &apos;m the one &apos;s got the big stick . 
just keep quiet . 
looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who &apos;s better than who ,  don &apos;t we ,  epps ?   like i said; i expected more from you . 
i told you ,  i &apos;m shooting iraqis . 
wellllll ,  if you read it it must be true .  was it in the star ,  or the enquirer ? 
but that &apos;s the great thing about gold .   a little goes a long way . 
figure they don &apos;t want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them . 
and you missed this ?   how are you going to miss something like this ? 
how &apos;m i gonna relax standing on a mine !  ? 
why you got to move away to talk !  ? 
you &apos;re moving away because it &apos;s going to blow up ,  isn &apos;t it !  ?   it &apos;s going to blow up ! 
i said nobody dies .   nobody dies . 
how &apos;s this going to work ? 
you &apos;re going to blow yourselves up . 
you &apos;re not losing trust ,  are you ? 
iraqis .   a bunch of them . 
x marks the spot . 
where the hell is it !  ? 
get up and dig . 
maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore . 
it &apos;s not like i figured .   it &apos;s cold .   and it &apos;s heavier than i imagined . 
he &apos;s not going to leave us . 
we should head northeast . 
i never killed anybody before .   i talk a good game ,  but i &apos;m not like that . 
wonder how the war &apos;s going ? 
getting cold . 
epps .  .  . epps !   i &apos;m gonna stop for a second . 
just let me rest for a second . 
which boarder ?   saudi ?   kuwait ?   syria ? 
that &apos;s if the war is even still going on .  way things were shaping up it &apos;s probably long over . 
an iraqi ? 
what do we do ? 
 .  .  . wes .  .  .  ? 
some good ones . 
yeah ,  a headache .   my head hurts .   you &apos;re making me uncomfortable . 
how do you say  &quot; come here ,  baby .   i &apos;m horny .  &quot;   i can use that now . 
it &apos;s a puzzle box .   if you can figure out how to open it there &apos;s supposed to be a treasure inside . 
jaeger ? 
jaeger ? 
you ever think about dying ? 
at - at - at - at - at . 
we .  .  . we could go home with something else . 
it &apos;s not a hundred miles .   it &apos;s a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain :   pure desert ,  mountains ,  a river .   if the map is even real . 
epps ,  is that a sand dune . 
yeah !   gold !   how much ? 
yeah !   yeah ! 
we &apos;re not stranded .   we &apos;ve got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back . 
really ?   what is that ,  an order ,  private< / u> ? 
epps .  .  . 
if all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself . 
what do you think ? 
you down ? 
think the iraqi &apos;s killed them all ? 
drug evasion with assorted perversions
no ,  your going to eat it ,  or it will go to waste . 
what did you get ? 
i have to .  .  .  he &apos;s a g - 34
i haven &apos;t done anything . 
i was so scared .  .  . i didn &apos;t know what would happen with you .  .  . once i started .   i almost let you go on so many times .   it will be worth it ,  together .   when i was alone ,  i knew . 
what time is it ? 
i &apos;ll try . 
if i take something ,  you suffer .  if i don &apos;t ,  i stuff .  .  .  . 
they know .   they &apos;ve been watching us .   i can feel it . 
but we need a creative dissent .  our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus ,  but the differences are differences of emphasis ,  not of fundamentals .  now ,  the new alignment &apos;s greatest need is to communicate with all its elements ,  rather than march along in parallel line that never converge .   tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly ,  we will gain a new unity . 
good lord ! 
that &apos;s the most ridiculous thing i &apos;ve ever heard . 
how far did you go ?   was it cold ? 
what are you doing here ?   you &apos;re not cleared for this area ! 
 .  .  . it doesn &apos;t matter .   the rest of it just didn &apos;t happen . 
yes
 .  .  .  . i &apos;m taking sp5 ,  but it doesn &apos;t seem strong enough .   i have a hard time concentrating .   please forgive me ,  i slipped on .  .  .  . 
may i help you ?

mr .  andrews ,  i did the sum in my head ,  and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned .  .  .  forgive me ,  but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard . 
no !  i &apos;ll do this with or without your help ,  sir .  but without will take longer . 
who &apos;s the best ?  say it . 
we &apos;ve put together the world &apos;s largest database on the titanic .  okay ,  here .  .  . 
holy shit . 
i make my own luck . 
you know i don &apos;t like that ,  rose . 
it &apos;s just the god damned english doing everything by the book . 
an accident ?  ! 
i was leaning way over ,  to see the .  .  .  ah .  .  .  propellers .  and i slipped and i would have gone overboard .  .  .  and mr .  dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself . 
my god .  .  .  cal .  is it a  -  - 
yes .  your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting . 
something serious has happened . 
where are you going ?  to him ?  is that it ?  to be a whore to that gutter rat ? 
yes ,  i lived .  how awkward for you . 
i don &apos;t understand a one of you .  what &apos;s the matter with you ?  it &apos;s your men back there !  we got plenty a &apos; room for more . 
captain ,  the press knows the size of titanic ,  let them marvel at her speed too .  we must give them something new to print .  and the maiden voyage of titanic must make headlines ! 
well ,  do you think the ship is seriously damaged ? 
no you won &apos;t . 
well they have some of the coldest winters around ,  and i grew up there ,  near chippewa falls .  once when i was a kid me and my father were ice -  fishing out on lake wissota .  .  .  ice -  fishing &apos;s where you chop a hole in the  -  - 
i &apos;m jack dawson . 
help !  help !  ! 
here i am .  i .  .  .  i want to thank you for what you did .  not just for .  .  .  for pulling me back .  but for your discretion . 
i don &apos;t .  .  .  it wasn &apos;t just one thing .  it was everything .  it was them ,  it was their whole world .  and i was trapped in it ,  like an insect in amber .   i just had to get away .  .  .  just run and run and run .  .  .  and then i was at the back rail and there was no more ship .  .  .  even the titanic wasn &apos;t big enough .  not enough to get away from them .  and before i &apos;d really though about it ,  i was over the rail .  i was so furious .  i &apos;ll show them .  they &apos;ll be sorry ! 
jack ,  these are quite good !  really ,  they are . 
and these were drawn from life ? 
why can &apos;t i be like you jack ?  just head out for the horizon whenever i feel like it .   say we &apos;ll go there ,  sometime .  .  .  to that pier .  .  .  even if we only ever just talk about it . 
that was a long one .  my father used to say that whenever you saw one ,  it was a soul going to heaven . 
that guy lovejoy put it in my pocket . 
you jump ,  i jump ,  right ? 
never let go . 
louis the sixteenth wore a fabulous stone ,  called the blue diamond of the crown ,  which disappeared in 1792 ,  about the time louis lost everything from the neck up .  the theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too .  .  .  recut into a heart - like shape .  .  .  and it became le coeur de la mer .  the heart of the ocean .  today it would be worth more than the hope diamond . 
rose ,  this is not a game !  our situation is precarious .  you know the money &apos;s gone ! 
but ,  anya ,  dear !  unless you play we won &apos;t have a fourth . 
hope we &apos;re not intruding . 
feeling a little better ,  i see .

hello ,  young fellow ! 
that &apos;s all right .  i &apos;ll attend to this . 
i won &apos;t -  - i &apos;ll ask for one right now .   sally tells me she &apos;s in love with you . 
yes -  - but don &apos;t ask me why -  - because i could never tell you .  i don &apos;t know what most guys want out of life -  - but that< / u> would be enough for me -  - i wouldn &apos;t care about -  -  easy money -  - or -  - showing off my smart brains -  - i &apos;d just like to live my< / u> life so nothing i did would bounce back and ruin hers< / u> -  - do i make myself clear ? 
eighty cents a word -  - three -  - six -  - nine words .  that &apos;ll be seven twenty ,  but it &apos;s too much -  - i &apos;ll show you how to save some money .

congratulations . 
that &apos;s the truth -  - every single word !

the man dealing faro .   who is he ? 
a peace officer .  .  .  impressive man
i saw that look on your face just now .  what &apos;s between you and wyatt ? 
feel bad about ol &apos; fred .   just can &apos;t hold back when i &apos;m feelin &apos; woolly .   still ,  feel kinda bad .  but now we &apos;re square .   anyway no use for holdin &apos; a grudge .   i deserved a rap in the head . 
here ,  doc . 
we must talk ,  darling .   it appears we have to .  .  .  redefine the nature of our association . 
sheriff behan ,  doc holliday . 
so tell me ,  wyatt .   i &apos;m curious .  do you actually consider youself a married man ?   forsaking all others ? 
nonsense ,  i have not yet begun to defile myself . 
wyatt ,  my god !   you &apos;re shot to pieces ! 
i &apos;m a man without fear ,  wyatt .   i literally don &apos;t care if i live or die .   but even i can &apos;t fight human instinct .   somebody suddenly starts shooting at me ,  i duck .  but you .  .  .  what on earth were you thinking about ? 
rather an obvious question under the circumstances ,  don &apos;t you agree ?   a better one might be how do you feel ? 
drunks .   crawfished a bet ,  called him a liar .   i saw the whole thing . 
then why in hell &apos;re you doin &apos; this ?   you ought to be in bed . 
i don &apos;t believe it .   he &apos;s clean ! 
praise jesus ! 
what is it ? 
of course ,  i &apos;m always happy .  unless i &apos;m bored .   that blonde woman ,  is that your wife ? 
just answer . 
oh look ,  i haven &apos;t got time to be proper ,  i want to live .   i &apos;m a woman ,  i like men .   if that &apos;s unladylike then i guess i &apos;m not a lady .   at least i &apos;m honest . 
what &apos;s wrong ? 
you feel bad about this ?   about me ? 
those cowboys &apos;re tellin &apos; everybody in town they &apos;re gonna clean you out .   they &apos;re down in that lot right now behind the ok corral . 
come up to the fire ,  honey . 
out ridin &apos; .   so .  .  .  how you doin &apos; ? 
run for your lives ,  boys !   it &apos;s that great two - gun dog - catcher from kansas ! 
so what about you cowboys anyway ? 
next waterhole &apos;s black draw .   we could be there by mid - morning . 
there they are .   no herd though . 
all right ,  say you &apos;re right ,  say you don &apos;t get yourself killed .  there &apos;s something else .   it &apos;s too late for virge ,  he already rolled his bone .   but it &apos;s not too late for you ,  morg . 
how you doin &apos; ,  boy ? 
remember about the light you &apos;re supposed to see when you &apos;re dyin &apos; ? 
that a fact ? 
got a sheaf of federal warrants .  being in the territories it &apos;s up to our discretion how they &apos;re served .   that means we got the cowboys without quarter .   the black flag ,  brother .   no prisoners ,  no mercy ,  amen . 
we should get moving . 
allie - girl .  .  . and louisa !   you &apos;re so lovely .   i &apos;m at your feet ,  darlin &apos; .   just at your feet .   guess it &apos;s only right .   ma always said you were the prettiest . 
you know ,  i was thinkin &apos; ,  maybe we ought to open our own place .  that &apos;s the real money .   build it up ,  milk it for all it &apos;s worth ,  then sell it off for a bundle and breeze out of this burg with more money than croesus and ready to live like kings .   let &apos;s you and me take a walk around town ,  virge ,  see if we can scout us out a couple of nice lots . 
wait till the liquor wears off .  once they start getting headaches they &apos;ll lose interest . 
getting late .   guess i &apos;ll turn in . 
virgil ? 
ike clanton ,  old man &apos;s eldest son .   know he ain &apos;t got the stuff ,  makes him miserable . 
but  - 
why wasn &apos;t the ship protected ?  !  ?  !  why was it sailing without radar ? 
at least we know where the gold is .  when are the recovery ships due ? 
how did you get this number ? 
my third great uncle  -  the earl of aberdeen  -  negotiated the purchase of hong kong from the chinese .   his son - in - law  -  george harmsway  -  made the first family fortune ,  running opium into shanghai .  .  .   his son ,  thomas ,  who lost it ,  smoking the opium .  .  .  and my grandfather henry ,  who opened the first telegraph station ,  and published the colony &apos;s first english newspaper .   it was a city of unlimited possibility . 
 .  .  . although it must be fun to have all those satellites . 
 .  .  . and what &apos;s that ,  my dear ? 
are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl ? 
 .  .  . as the advertising says :  tomorrow never lies . 
next morning .  both boats .  nothing wrong .   my 90 year old grandfather thinks  &apos;ghost in the computer  -  silicon dragon .  &apos;
i &apos;m sure she is ,  james .  but i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ll have to  &apos;kiss off &apos; the rest of your lessons this afternoon . 
by the way ,  james :  ordinarily i would never ask ,  but .  .  .  weren &apos;t you and that colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the sargasso sea ? 
do i have to dial  &apos;9 &apos; to get out ? 
wait a minute  - 
yes ,  the ship is down there .  but the gold is gone . 
just  -  say it .  say it just once . 
there is one last thing ,  007 :  elliot harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation .  he &apos;s also a major contributor to the party .  i expect him to be given every consideration . 
finally ,  your new watch :  blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button ,  the sweep hand becomes a geiger counter . 
they point ,  i shoot . 
have we met ? 
actually ,  i &apos;m here on business .  you might say it was a .  .  .  golden opportunity . 
no ? 
do i have to do everything around here ? 
just remember :  they think there &apos;s ten billion dollars in gold down there . 
put your back to the railing .  sit up on it . 
put your arms around my neck .  lock your legs around my waist . 
tell me ,  007 ,  what do you know about elliot harmsway ? 
 .  .  .  and what do you call these ? 
tsi tien ,  mr .  bond . 
what &apos;s your name ? 
i know my rights .  these are international waters .  the british navy abandoned that boat ,  and i &apos;m claiming it .  under international law ,  i have the right to salvage what &apos;s on that wreck . 
i was an attorney ! 
no . 
the american presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story  - 
and the 9 : 30 news meeting is waiting . 
the back - up does the same thing . 
he brought that up from the wreck . 
how sweet . 
the drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel . 
 -  built to withstand a nuclear blast .   are they alive ? 
please sir .  please  - 
mr .  stamper will escort you to the plane . 
what did your wife get her ? 
how come you &apos;re not wearing my shoes ? 
when are you boys going to fix that roof ? 
you used that excuse to get out of the army . 
i &apos;m leaving and don &apos;t even call me when the shoe falls  &apos;cause all he did for me was to try and run my life .  i &apos;m tired of people saying babe brother this ,  babe brother that .  what &apos;s my name ? 
i &apos;ll drive her to the hospital . 
i &apos;m cold .  i need to get out into the sunlight . 
you would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1 / 2 baths mean . 
why does he always pick on me ? 
harry is coming to pick me up . 
did you ever have to use this thing ? 
never play with someone &apos;s else &apos;s cards .  you always get a new deck .  look at this card .  see anything ? 
you know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock . 
well ,  you just have to move further out . 
my mind plays tricks on me .  is it okay if i take a bath now ? 
babe brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation .  i hate to be mean to people but picking sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end .  now i &apos;m going to ask him how come he couldn &apos;t be at your birthday . 
let us settle this tomorrow . 
i asked you to wake me when babe brother comes . 
i &apos;m not going to let him get away with murder . 
i &apos;m trying to make him a man but you keep babying him . 
since this morning . 
he &apos;s going to check out heaven first .  he gets a round trip ticket to heaven .  he gets in heaven and finds it just like back home .  people dripping with sweat ,  working in the fields ,  hardly surviving .  he asked a man who was getting a drink of water ,   &quot; i thought the streets were paved with gold .  &quot;   &quot; they are but you won &apos;t see them ,  &quot;  he said .   &quot; boy ,  you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness .  &quot;  so he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell .  he sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back ,  picking their teeth .   &quot; man ,  this is a dream .  &quot;  he asked ,   &quot; what &apos;s you &apos;ll doing ?  &quot;  they all hollered back ,   &quot; sinning .  &quot;  the devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said ,   &quot; please to meet you .  &quot;  he asked ,   &quot; i thought you &apos;ll was supposed to be burning in fire .  &quot;  someone said ,   &quot; man ,  ain &apos;t no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins .  &quot;  the man was going go ask the preacher back on earth .  .  . 
man ,  put your boxes down and stay as long as you like .  we have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out . 
it &apos;s the boy next door throwing at his birds .  i &apos;m just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
oh ,  i would feel much at home if you let me get one for you .  i haven &apos;t wrung a chicken &apos;s neck in a month of sundays .  you know ,  folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs .  that used to be my trade from time to time . 
how often is your wife called to help delivery ? 
boy ,  i thought you were about to cross the river . 
good evening .  it must be all the different time zones i crossed that makes me feel this weary . 
hocker &apos;s death almost caused a race riot .  a lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that . 
those boys never did have good luck . 
a woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days . 
i was quoting from the bible .  if the shoe fits ,  wear it . 
not you mustn &apos;t touch .  your mama might not like you handling knives . 
we can &apos;t really bring another family in here with us . 
he just leeches off your parents .  he is a master at wearing out welcome . 
yeah ?  ! 
woody !   buzz !

you &apos;d think they &apos;ve never seen a new toy before . 
we &apos;re almost there .

a lunchbox ?  ! 
did you all take stupid pills this morning ?  !   have you forgotten what he did to buzz ?   and now you want to let him back over here ? 
wait just a minute .   what are you trying to pull ?  ! 
no wait !   you don &apos;t understand !  buzz is out there !   we &apos;ve gotta help him !  ! 
it &apos;s too short !   we need more monkeys ! 
come in ,  mother bird ,  this is alpha bravo . 
oh ,  no .  .  . it &apos;s a combat carl .

i &apos;m red this time . 
oh .  .  . well alright ,  you can be red if you want . 
ha ,  ha ,  oh ,  i love you ,  too . 
he can &apos;t abide a woman in trousers .  he says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature . 
is there anything else i should know about him ? 
she &apos;s not accustomed to being ignored . 
what was that< / i> in aid of ? 
who &apos;s there ? 
he &apos;ll murder you when he finds out . 
somebody couldn &apos;t wait until dark . 
 &apos;have ploughed the stormy seas  -   &apos;
no ,  of course not .   she &apos;s one of the top students at her school . 
what is he planning on telling them ? 
i understand .   you &apos;re upset .   you want to know what &apos;s going on .   that &apos;s good . 
how much do i pay him ? 
this place is swept twice a day .   i learned that in miami in  &apos;85 .   then the u . s .  shut down the whole caribbean ,  but it &apos;s a big game of wack - a - mole .   knock it down in miami ,  it pops up here .   and san diego is so much more relaxing . 
laundromats for the washing of money .  unfortunately ,  carl had only one successful business . 
you had it all figured out .   you move into my house .   you raise my kids .   you sleep with my wife .   it was a good plan ,  arnie . 
stop .   you experimented in college .  i don &apos;t want to hear about that . 
czar for life ,  just like a real czar . 
are you going to ? 
what &apos;s it like ?   imagine you &apos;re being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of calcutta ,  except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don &apos;t say  &quot; please &quot;  or  &quot; thank you .  &quot; 
 .  .  . how old are you ? 
how are your grades ? 
what &apos;s that mean ? 
remember when we sat on that mob guy ,  that chef ,  for like six months ? 
what do you think it is ? 
you planning on going somewhere ,  eduardo ?   you don &apos;t like it here ?  this is the best situation you &apos;re going to have for a long ,  long time . 
why do you say that ,  mr .  marquez ? 
that &apos;s good coke . 
wasn &apos;t that general salazar ? 
if you want her to stay out of it ,  then stop telling her everything .  you should learn how to keep a secret . 
this is fucking crazy .   instead of killing us ,  he sends us on a suicide mission .   do you know who frankie flowers is ?   he &apos;s a psycho - cokehead -  hitman .   a faggot .   he &apos;s killed fucking who knows how many people .  you &apos;d need half the force to get close to him .   and you can &apos;t get their help because he lives in fucking san diego . 
madrigal &apos;s alive . 
somewhere safe . 
i &apos;m trying to bust the tijuana cartel . 
you watch and learn .   i earn his trust .   then more pain .   then i appear with kindness .   within a week he will follow me around like a dog . 
let me ask you a hypothetical question :  if salazar worked for madrigal and the juaraz cartel ,  and he went out of power ,  would it mean the juarez cartel is losing influence ? 
the busiest land border crossing in the world .   over forty - one thousand vehicles per day ,  twenty - two thousand pedestrians on foot .   i think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through . 
i &apos;m looking for my daughter ,  caroline .  she comes here . 
she &apos;s not at that place you sent her ? 
can you tell me anything ?   do you have any ideas ? 
i &apos;m not the police .   i don &apos;t care about experimentation .   she &apos;s a kid .  i &apos;m worried to death . 
hello . 
who do we interface with on their side ? 
did you tell him ? 
no ,  i don &apos;t mean like that  -  -  i mean something nice ,  like ,  that &apos;s all  -  - 
hey ,  i &apos;m wanting a bet put on . 
this was his nightmare .  the dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck - ups in town .  i knew what was going on in his mind :  any trouble in london and he would dump us immediately ,  one way or another .  he had to .  if he got caught with a bagful of skag ,  on top of that armed robbery shit ,  he was going down for fifteen to twenty .  begbie was hard ,  but not so hard that he didn &apos;t shite it off twenty years in saughton . 
christ ,  i haven &apos;t felt that good since archie gemmill scored against holland in 1978 . 
in that case you can do it .  you were quite happy to do a lot more last night . 
what do you want ? 
well ,  it isn &apos;t . 
well ,  you &apos;re not going to tell anyone ,  are you ,  and besides ,  i thought we could meet up afterwards ,  maybe go somewhere together . 
no ,  toxoplasmosis .  sort of like a stroke . 
strive ,  hope ,  believe and conquer . 
thanks ,  mark . 
it &apos;s a tightrope ,  spud ,  a fucking tightrope . 
fuck off !  he never wrote any of them . 
you don &apos;t know ,  do you ? 
well ,  at one time ,  you &apos;ve got it ,  and then you lose it ,  and it &apos;s gone for ever .  all walks of life :  george best ,  for example ,  had it and lost it ,  or david bowie ,  or lou reed  - 
yeah ,  beautifully fucking illustrated . 
oh ,  fuck .  sick boy reaches out to allison . 
eughh .  sounds horrible . 
how much ? 
so ? 
and would sir care to settle his bill in advance ? 
it &apos;s the great outdoors . 
it &apos;s fresh air . 
six weeks and no sex ? 
big time .  absolutely fucking radge .   &apos;it &apos;s me or iggy pop ,  time to decide .  &apos;
well ,  what are you waiting for ? 
homeless people ? 
mr .  murphy ,  {leaving your friend aside , } do you see yourself as having any weaknesses ? 
qual se tu ? 
no ,  no ,  it &apos;s not possible . 
my visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees . 
sulu ,  what are you doing ? 
this is the starship enterprise . 
this is captain pavel chekov speaking .  you are in violation of neutral zone treaty .  i advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences . 
you caught me on my way to the shower . 
on  &quot; the planet of galactic peace ?  &quot; 
you told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks .  i gave you three .  what happened ? 
don &apos;t you worry ,  captain .  we &apos;ll beat those klingon devils even if i have to get out and push . 
standard orbit ,  mr .  sulu . 
respond with static .  let them think we &apos;re having difficulty .  which wouldn &apos;t be far from the truth . 
 &quot; pack up your troubles .  &quot; 
come on ,  spock .  why didn &apos;t you jump in ? 
there was a young student ,  exceptionally gifted ,  possessing of great intelligence .  it was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of vulcan .  but he was a revolutionary . 
he rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors . 
their equipment is primitive but effective .  i recommend we land at coordinate 8563 . 
damnit ,  spock .  god damnit ! 
look ,  the man may be a fellow vulcan ,  but that doesn &apos;t .  .  . 
you did too .  sybok couldn &apos;t possibly be your brother because i happen to know for a fact that you don &apos;t have a brother . 
spock . 
spock .  .  .  don &apos;t . 
what you fear is the unknown .  the people of your planet once believed their world was flat .  columbus proved it was round .  they said the sound barrier could never be broken .  it was broken .  they said warp speed could not be achieved .  the great barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear .  it &apos;s an extension of personal fear .   captain kirk ,  i so much want your understanding .  i want your respect .  are you afraid to hear me out ? 
your vision ? 
about the ship .  .  . 
no ,  no ,  no .  scotty  -  scotty .  .  .  there &apos;s so much i want to tell you . 
sybok ,  you must surrender . 
yepper .  and vice squad ,  and meltdown .  .  .  whole slew of  &apos;em .  i was this close  to starting my own little enterprise .  but :  enter ed dillinger .  another software engineer  -  -  not so young ,  not so bright ,  but very ,  very sneaky .  one night ,  our boy flynn goes to his terminal ,  tries to read up his file ,  and  .  .  .  nothing .  a big blank .  we now take you to three months later .  ed dillinger presents icom with five video games he has  &quot; invented &quot;   -  -  the slime didn &apos;t even change the names  -  -  and he gets a big fat promotion .  thus begins his meteoric rise to .  .  . what is he now ,  executive v . p .  ? 
dillinger ? 
my dinner . 
no problem ,  master - c .  if you &apos;ve seen one consumer electronics show .  .  .   what &apos;s up ? 
cute . 
it shouldn &apos;t be any harder than general motors was .  but now .  .  . this is what i get for using humans . 
really .  you &apos;d have programs lined up around the block to use this place  -  -  and no mcp looking over your shoulder . 
who is your user ,  program ? 
dumont ! 
alan ! 
a user  -  -  in our world ? 
hey ,  ram  .  .  .  what were you  .  .  .  you know ,  before ? 
oh ,  uh .  .  . i don &apos;t remember too much .  .  .

you have any idea how much i can sue these jokers for ? 
you &apos;ve got it .  i &apos;ve been hopin &apos; you &apos;d send me somebody with a little moxie  .  .  .  what kind of program is he ? 
but - what if i can &apos;t .  .  .  ? 
yes ,  and now you &apos;ve got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation . 
yori .  .  .  hey .  .  . 
this is flynn .  .  .  the one who busted me out . 
what is it ? 
nice .  .  . 
i mean ,  it &apos;s not like he &apos;s saving the world or anything .   he &apos;s a sales rep for chrissakes .  whenever i can &apos;t get to sleep i ask him to tell me about his day .  six seconds and i &apos;m out .   but he acts like he &apos;s curing cancer or something . 
where are you going ? 
that &apos;s not true ,  honey -  - 
i &apos;m done . 
you seem fine now . 
you &apos;d tell me if there was something wrong ,  wouldn &apos;t you ,  pumpkin ? 
faisil .   you &apos;re new on harry &apos;s team ,  aren &apos;t you ? 
kids .   ten seconds of joy .  thirty years of misery .

okay .   okay .   de - nail ain &apos;t just a river in egypt .   she &apos;s probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion . 
harry tasker .   one zero zero two four .

now what ? 
we &apos;re dead ,  right ?   so .  .  .  where &apos;d you put the transmitter ? 
he &apos;s got it . 
well ,  what &apos;s the point of waiting ? 
so your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters ? 
yes . 
you think i care about their     * cause ?   or yours ?   not at all .      * see ,  america is on top now  .    .     *  .   but so was rome ,  once .   all     * civilizations crumble .   one nation succeeding over another .  what does it mean in the long run ?   the only important thing is to live well .   and .  .  .   living     * well takes money .        *

i &apos;m late .

we want tough minded people .   strong mentally .   we &apos;ve had some .  .  . misfortunes with  &quot; unstable &quot;  types . 
he &apos;s drugged out of his mind !   he &apos;s completely zoned out . 
we &apos;re very close !   because of you ! 
wow ,  a guy in a chevy is chasing her and some other guy i can &apos;t see .

mr .  cole ?   my name is doctor railly .  i &apos;m a psychiatrist .   i work for the county  -  -  i don &apos;t work for the police .  my only concern is your well being  -  -  do you understand that ? 
what year do you think it is ? 
my father told me that .    &quot; never cry wolf .  &quot;   then people won &apos;t believe you if .  .  . something really happens . 
did something terrible happen to you when you were a child ?   something so bad .  .  .  ? 
about an airport .  .  . before everything happened .   it &apos;s the same dream i always have  -  -  the only one .   i &apos;m a little kid in it . 
no ,  i think it was always you .   it &apos;s very strange . 
my notes .   observations .   clues . 
does that disturb you ,  james ?   thinking about that little boy in the well ? 
look ,  i &apos;m warning you .   you do anything ,  i &apos;m going to go crazy  -  -  hurt people ! 
oh ,  jesus ,  james !   you killed him ! 
i said i was too young to drive .   i didn &apos;t say i was stupid . 
you were going to run out off gas on purpose ,  weren &apos;t you ? 
what have you done ?   did you .  .  . kill someone ? 
okay .  .  . you were standing there looking at the moon .  .  . you were eating grass .  .  .  then what ? 
i want to be here .   in this time .   with you .   i want to become .  .  . become a whole person .   i want this to be the present .  i want the future to be unknown . 
it &apos;s a carpet cleaning company .  .  . 
no superiors !   no scientists .   no people from the future .   it &apos;s just a carpet cleaning company .   they have voice mail  -  -  you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned . 
i have seen it ,  but i don &apos;t remember this part .   funny ,  it &apos;s like what &apos;s happening to us ,  like the past .   the movie never changes  -  -  it can &apos;t change  -  -  but everytime you see it ,  it seems to be different because you &apos;re different  -  -  you notice different things . 
that &apos;s what they were up to !   freeing animals ! 
what &apos;d they give you ?   thorazine ?   how much ?   learn your drugs  -  -  know your doses . 
 &quot; what about the germs ?  &quot;   i say .   he goes ,   &quot; i don &apos;t believe in germs .   germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap !  &quot;  now ,  he &apos;s crazy ,  right ?   hey ,  you believe in germs ,  don &apos;t you ?

kathryn ,  you know he can &apos;t possibly know that .   you &apos;re a rational person .  you &apos;re a trained psychiatrist .   you know the difference between what &apos;s real and what &apos;s not . 
what virus are we talking about ,  dad ? 
get me a dr .  peppa !   i don &apos;t want no pepsi .   pepsi ain &apos;t nothing but flavored water . 
don &apos;t forget to open it for me .   i can &apos;t be opening my own bottle . 
maybe one day i &apos;ll get to sit on a corner and spout wise . 
the day wasn &apos;t so bad .   we all got through it all right . 
no and i don &apos;t plan on sticking around either .   i don &apos;t guess i &apos;ll be seeing you again .   take it easy . 
i &apos;ll take a piece of that bet .  i say it doesn &apos;t come up five times each side . 
a coin &apos;s got two sides .   when you flip it there &apos;s a fifty - fifty chance it &apos;ll be heads or tails .   boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it &apos;ll come up each side . 
but ,  in particular ? 
we have a bus to mexico .   arrives in two hours .   have to make a couple of connections ,  but it will get you across the border . 
but he &apos;s dead . 
that &apos;ll make five in a row .   never seen it so hot .   sometimes i don &apos;t even want to get out of bed .   i &apos;d rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze .   i was in mexico this one time -  - 
well ,  you know so much why don &apos;t you just fix it yourself ? 
somewhere else ?   mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here .   how you planning on getting it there ?  you gonna push this heap yourself ? 
how much ? 
about an hour and a half ,  because that &apos;s all the longer i &apos;ve been gone . 
that yours ,  mrs .  mckenna ? 
there you go ,  mrs .  mckenna .   just put it in there . 
i put up new drapes ,  jake . 
they look nice . 
how could i ?   i was sleeping . 
maybe i don &apos;t want you to . 
that a fact ? 
thank you ,  john . 
what happens if you lose ? 
must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house . 
did you ever ? 
it &apos;s not that easy .   maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please .   i can &apos;t .   i don &apos;t want to be alone .   i need to know i &apos;m going to be taken care of . 
is it pretty ? 
i know where we could get the money .  a lot more than one - hundred - fifty dollars . 
jake . 
he doesn &apos;t give it to us .   we take it . 
he &apos;s got money .   in a floor safe in the living room .   i &apos;ve never seen it ,  but he talks about it all the time .   more like brags .   he loves his money .   wouldn &apos;t think of spending some of it on me . 
near as i can figure must be about a hundred - thousand . 
lied ?   what do you mean ? 
it &apos;s not a combination lock .   it takes a key .   he keeps it on him all the time .   i mean all the time .   it scratches up against me when we do it . 
what are you talking about ? 
i don &apos;t think we have anything to talk about . 
there is no us ,  remember ? 
i came back for you; this morning i came back .   before i even knew about the money .  you &apos;re what i want . 
if it isn &apos;t here ,  why would he wear that stupid key ? 
you got a suitcase ? 
i got the money all packed .   i put the jeep in the garage .   figure that way people will think maybe me and jake went away .   might buy us some time . 
are you kidding ?   i &apos;m not going down with you for killing a cop . 
the police don &apos;t know that .   and it &apos;s going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck .   i &apos;ll take you as far as california .   if we can even make that .   after that i &apos;m cutting you loose . 
are you all right ? 
it &apos;s  .   .   .  it &apos;s locked . 
someone will find me . 
she does at that .   i knew when i married her she was a free spirit .  a woman with her looks and a man my age; what was i to expect ?   but you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don &apos;t think ,  you do .  so ,  i married her .   what are you to do ,  eh ?   women . 
i &apos;m surprised to see you .   i thought you &apos;d be halfway to vegas by now . 
nice office you &apos;ve got . 
sweet grace ?   what about her ? 
let &apos;s say i do want her dead .   what is it you want ?   this morning you weren &apos;t a killer . 
just to get out of here ?   that doesn &apos;t seem much for a murder . 
twenty - thousand ?   i don &apos;t have that kind of money .   i won &apos;t get the insurance until months after she &apos;s dead .   i don &apos;t imagine you &apos;ll want to be around after poor grace &apos;s demise .   twenty - thousand; that &apos;s more money than i could ever get my hands on . 
what should i do ? 
this is what you do :   go to the house to see her . 
you know so much about killing why don &apos;t you do it yourself ? 
shut up . 
jake ,  how much were you going to pay me to do the job ? 
jake -  - 
i came for grace . 
it &apos;s the truth ,  jake . 
not from where i stand . 
you &apos;d tell me anything to save your pathetic life . 
toby !   toby tyler ,  leave him alone ! 
you ain &apos;t from oz .   oz is in that one movie . 
you &apos;re too late ,  toby .   we &apos;re going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind . 
i don &apos;t care what you believe as long as you leave me alone . 
you &apos;re fucked . 
that &apos;s right ,  mister .   you better be afraid .   i told you it wasn &apos;t over ,  but you didn &apos;t listen .   now i find you sneakin &apos; around with my girl behind my back . 
i &apos;m doing what any man would do if he &apos;d been offended .   i &apos;m beating you up . 
now ,  what &apos;s this ? 
nooo ! 
let me guess .   this robber; he gets your money . 
fucking kid .   and look at you; breaking fucking pencils .   you &apos;re a neanderthal . 
he is at that .   no so much a fault of his own .   poor boy had quite a trauma as a child . 
i think you might just want to do as i say . 
i didn &apos;t do anything . 
soda .   you got any soda ? 
hey !   you there ! 
i thought you said you lost your eyes in the war ? 
 .  .  . but ain &apos;t you got a little something for the infirm ? 
night is when you want to sleep ,  but the dry heat keeps you tossin &apos; and turnin &apos; .  it &apos;s when you wish the sun was bakin &apos; high in the sky so you could see what it is you &apos;re afraid of . 
afraid of it ?   boy ,  i live in the dark .  all cause of a woman who made me this way .  people are afraid of what they can &apos;t see .  i can &apos;t see nuthin &apos; ,  so it &apos;s all the same to me .   kiss from a beautiful woman ,  kissy kissy kiss ,  a lick from a dog ,  slurp ,  slurp ,  the kiss of death  .  it &apos;s all the same to me . 
nothing makes the great spirit laugh harder than a man &apos;s plans .  we all got plans .  i planned on seeing all my life .  i know you didn &apos;t plan on straying into town . 
you are< / u> crazy ,  you know .  be seeing you ,  old man . 
i don &apos;t care what you believe as long as you leave me alone . 
christ ,  i don &apos;t believe this ! 
that &apos;s right ,  mister .   you better be afraid .   i told you it wasn &apos;t over ,  but you didn &apos;t listen .   now i find you sneakin &apos; around with my girl behind my back . 
i &apos;m doing what any man would do if he &apos;d been offended .   i &apos;m stompin &apos; your ass . 
i guess we &apos;ve never been introduced proper .  jake mckenna . 
i hope so .   listen ,  mckenna about your wife :   if i had known she was married -  - 
would you ? 
sweet grace ?   what about her ? 
you said you &apos;d cut that up with the man who did her in . 
you meant it . 
next time you &apos;ll do just fine . 
no ,  but it don &apos;t matter anyway when you &apos;re lying there with your brains all over my carpet and i &apos;m telling sheriff potter about this drifter ,  didn &apos;t have enough money to fix his car .  and darrell happened to find his gun ,  and through maybe this drifter heard old jake got some money stashed away ,  and figgered he might try to break in and steal it ! 
you have a lot of talk in you ,  whole lot of talk . 
how the hell did you know where the bedroom &apos;s at ? 
what happened to your hand ? 
but you was going to fight for me . 
will he be back soon ? 
okay ,  i &apos;m stuck .   you happy ?   now can you fix it ,  or not ? 
i &apos;m very interested in this but is there someplace .  .  . 
hey . 
then you ain &apos;t gonna have the car . 
you think bad ,  and bad is what you get . 
it &apos;s going to cost you two - hundred dollars . 
well ,  now ,  you just know all there is about bein &apos; a mechanic ,  don &apos;t you ?   didn &apos;t you read the sign . 
two - hundred dollars in hundred - dollar bills .   and this morning you was broke . 
i don &apos;t want no dirty money .   i run an honest business . 
can i give you a hand ,  beautiful ? 
jesus . 
where you headed ? 
i guess .   i &apos;ve got an ego same as any man . 
where &apos;d you learn to do that ? 
nice house for a shaman &apos;s daughter .   you must be good . 
that &apos;s not an answer .   what is it you want ? 
you love him ? 
you &apos;d never understand . 
it &apos;s just such a mess .  with jake i mean .  .  . 
after he got his divorce ,  he forced me to marry him .  .  . but when i saw her body ,  i swore to her on my soul that some day i &apos;d get jake for what he did to her .  .  . 
are you sure ?  .  .  .   about me ,  i mean ? 
grace  .  .  .  grace ? 
i can &apos;t see it . 
so ,  aren &apos;t you going to ask me ? 
why ? 
well ,  nothing .  we dump jake ,  we split the money ,  then you &apos;re on your own . 
 .  .  . and let me guess .   this robber  -  -  he gets your money . 
mr .  arkady ,  honest ,  i ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed .  so now i don &apos;t have a cent to my name .  i can &apos;t even get my car out of the garage .   i tell you ,  mister .  .  .   if it weren &apos;t for bad luck i wouldn &apos;t have nay fuckin &apos; luck at all ,  you know ?    so ,  i was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty - dollars so i could get my car out of this garage ,  see ?   the bus depot here has a western union thing .   and of course i &apos;ll pay it back with the rest of the money . 
a hundred - forty - five would probably cover it . 
out of here . 
twenty - seven ,  fifty .   that &apos;s all i got . 
you got a beer ? 
heineken ? 
shasta !   now why &apos;d you go and scare the nice man like that ?   sorry about that ,  mister .   let &apos;s see ,  you want $3 . 25 .   you try to have a nice day now ,  would you ? 
son of a bitch ! 
yeah ,  i heard a key slapping against my ass . 
help me ,  grace ,  help .  .  . 
toby !   toby tucker ,  leave him alone ! 
where &apos;s the fire sweetheart ?  don &apos;t know how they work things in nevada ,  but we got speed limits in this state . 
get out of the car ,  spread them .  you can jawbone all you want or you have the right to shut the fuck up< / u> !  you commie motherfucker .  either way you &apos;re goin &apos; to the can . 
is that the entire message ? 
what about jeb ? 
okay . 
not a specific day .  what &apos;s this about ? 
when was the last time i wore pink ? 
what about the game ? 
how certain are you that you haven &apos;t been sick in your life ? 
seventy - five percent ?  that &apos;s not nearly good enough for me .  i &apos;m extremely skeptical . 
what &apos;s this about ?  this is obviously some scam .  is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment ? 
why is it ,  do you think ,  that of all the professions in the world .  .  .  you chose protection ? 
i thought he was carrying something . 
he &apos;s doing well today . 
he &apos;s kind of a miracle . 
when ? 
why &apos;d you do that ? 
you think you could beat up mike tyson ?  i mean before he started wiggin out and eating people &apos;s ears ? 
what do you do if something happens ? 
i &apos;ll just shoot him once . 
don &apos;t be scared . 
you represent someone in philadelphia ? 
you are in the emergency room of the university of pennsylvania hospital .  you were in a serious accident .   how &apos;s your vision ? 
where were you sitting on the train ? 
was your family traveling with you ? 
how so ? 
i didn &apos;t think they &apos;d really do it . 
that kid .  .  .  he &apos;s just a .  .  .  boy .  and that other one ,  bill ,  being true to his wife .  .  . 
some big guy beat the shit out of me .   i guess i must look a lot like you ,  huh ? 
yeah ,  i guess . 
been a long time ,  bob .  you run out of chinamen ? 
hell ,  yeah .  a bunch of us bar t boys went out lookin &apos; on account of them killin &apos; one of our own .  we come across this fucker on a roan goin &apos; south an &apos; .  .  . 
well .  .  .  uh .  .  .  i .  .  .  i ain &apos;t got no ,  uh ,  firearms . 
well ,  that bullet whizzin &apos; by panicked corky ,  an &apos; he done the wrong thing !  pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe .  meantime ,  bob aims good and squeezes off another .  .  .  but he &apos;s so drunk he misses again an &apos; hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar .  well ,  now the duck of death is good as dead  &apos;cause this time corky does right an &apos; aims real good ,  no hurry .  .  . 
bam !  that walker colt blew up in his hand .  .  .  which was a failing common to that model .  now if corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end . 
but if the other fellow is quicker and fires first .  .  . 
n - no ,  sir ?

what the hell do you want ? 
get out . 
what fence ?  who ? 
what is this ? 
what - are they speaking ? 
how are you ,  keaton ? 
what about redfoot ? 
ahh ,  mr .  hockney .  do join us . 
mr .  so -  my employer has made up his mind .  he does not change it . 
better you hear it from me now than somebody else later . 
what do you mean i can &apos;t see him ? 
i know what i wanted to know about keaton . 
a rumor is not a rumor that doesn &apos;t die . 
verbal ,  you know we &apos;re trying to help you . 
sure .  fifteen years ago ,  but he was a good thief anyway ,  the cops wouldn &apos;t let him go legit . 
according to your statement you are a short - con operator .  run of the mill seams .  everything you do ,  you learned from somebody else . 
you know ruby is in attica ? 
i &apos;11 get right to the point .  i &apos;m smarter than you .  i &apos;11 find out what i want to know and i &apos;11 get it from you whether you like it or not . 
oh come on ,  verbal .  who do you think you &apos;re talking to ?  you really expect me to believe he retired ?  for a woman ?  bullshit .  he was using her . 
you keep trying to lay this whole ride on                 t keaton .  it wasn &apos;t like that .  sure he knew ,  but edie had him all turned around .                  r i &apos;m telling you straight ,  i swear .                         +
no .  but i &apos;m sure keaton &apos;s dead . 
oh ,  but it &apos;s not .  if i hadn &apos;t been nailed in illinois for running a three card monte in between sets ,  i never would have took off for new york .  i never would have met keaton ,  see .  that barber shop quartet was the reason for everything . 
i wanted to .  i thought we could make it . 
a man in a suit with a slim build .  tall . 
i was afraid ,  okay ?  somehow ,  i was sure it was keyser soze at that point .  i couldn &apos;t bring myself to raise my gun to him . 
there were no drugs on that boat .  it was a hit .  a suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger keyser soze so sate had a few thieves put to it .  men he knew he could march into certain death . 
what did he find ? 
no  -  -  we don &apos;t want this case in court . 
i know that answer .   if we went to trial would we win ? 
that was our insurance company &apos;s recommendation . 
this is going to drive the ante up . 
you were there to help dr .  marx deliver her baby .   were you not ? 
mary rooney ,  the obstetrical nurse .  .  . 
what book is that ? 
 .  .  . of anesthesiology ? 
no further questions . 
 .  .  . sworn before god you would tell the truth ? 
now .   i &apos;d like to ask you something :  four years ago ,  when you were working as a nurse ,  are you aware that drs .  towler and marx based their treatment of deborah ann kaye on this chart that you signed  .   .   .   ? 
and wasn &apos;t that an oath .  .  .  ?   these are your initials here :   k . c .  when you signed this chart you took an oath .   no less important than that which you took today .    isn &apos;t that right ?    isn &apos;t that right .  .  .  ? 
please sit down .   i told your wife .  i &apos;m sorry that we have to meet out here .   i &apos;ve got a case coming in two days in the  superior court and my office is a mess of papers . 
you said you &apos;re gonna call me up .  you didn &apos;t call me up .   who do you think you are ?     who do you think you are .  .  .  ? 
then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men ,  to help a girl whose life &apos;s not going to be changed in the least ?    you know what code blue means ? 
dr .  thompson .  .  .  ? 
yes .   yes .   i think so .   i hope you &apos;ll be comfortable .   i &apos;m putting you up at my .  .  . 
 .  .  . apartment .    no ,  no .  please .   you don &apos;t know who we &apos;re dealing with ,  i ,  please believe me ,  they .  .  . 
i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s not true .    will you want me to stay on till monday ? 
you know .  .  . sometimes people can surprise you .   sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth . 
dr .  towler; page 406 ,   &apos;contraindications to general anaesthetic .   ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic .  &apos;  does that sound familiar ? 
 &apos;practice and methodology in anaesthesia .  &apos;  general textbook on the subject .   is  that correct ? 
i read the hospital report on your client . 
) i &apos;m sorry  .  .  .  ? 
uh ,  why ,  why are you doing this ? 
you think i &apos;m pushy now ,  wait  &apos;til i get you on the stand .  .  . 
and it seems to me ,  a fella &apos;s trying to come back ,  he &apos;d take this settlement ,  and get a record for himself .     i myself would take it and run like a thief . 
do we have time this morning to .  .  .  all right .   mr .  galvin ,  you want to continue now ,  or we can resume with dr .  thompson this afternoon . 
yes ,  mr .  galvin ?

`you guys are a bunch of whores .  .  . uh .  .  . loyalty .  .  . you don &apos;t care who gets hurt .  .  . you don &apos;t have any loyalty .  .  .  &apos;
uh .  .  . the admitting nurse .  .  . 
he saw her at the northern care .  .  . 
she told me . 
who told you that ? 
and did you write the numeral `one &apos; down on the record ,  standing for one hour ? 
 .  .  . they start again three minutes earlier .  .  . 
brain damage could have been .  .  . it didn &apos;t necessarily take nine minutes ,  it could have been caused in two .  .  . 
how &apos;d you get into the shipbuilding business ,  gavin ? 
i was sorry to read about that thing in the papers .   and you &apos;ve quit the force .   a permanent physical disability ?

i &apos;m afraid some harm may come to her . 
no . 
i want you . 
something else .  my wife ,  madeleine ,  has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to carlotta .  she inherited them .  never wore them ,  they were too old - fashioned .  .  .  until now .  now ,  when she is alone ,  she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently ,  curiously .  .  .  puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror .  .  .  and goes into that other world .  .  .  is someone else again . 
why ?   because i remind you of someone ?   that &apos;s not very complimentary .   and nothing would .  .  .  happen .  .  .

that &apos;s what i had in mind . 
no ,  i don &apos;t want to go .  i want to stay here .

have you been here before ? 
no ,  i can &apos;t tell you ! 
how do you know ?

a portrait ?  do you ever see a portrait ? 
of the woman in the mirror .  would you know her if you saw her ? 
you &apos;ve been there before .  you &apos;ve seen it . 
madeleine ,  a hundred miles south of san francisco there &apos;s an old spanish mission ,  mission san juan bautista .  it &apos;s been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum .  now ,  think hard ,  darling .  you &apos;ve been there before .  you &apos;ve seen it !

she died . 
well .  .  . 
can &apos;t do what ? 
no ,  because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about ,  which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me . 
name one . 
we were playing .  .  . she slipped .  .  . she hit her head . 
the floor was wet .  she slipped ! 
this is pathetic . 
don &apos;t point at me .

you got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife . 
what are you doing ? 
just wait a second .  wait one second .  okay .  what are you doing ? 
we have to call the ambulance . 
her blood is all over the bathroom .  i &apos;d say that &apos;s a bit of a dna problem . 
someone goes to walmart ,  gets some buckets ,  brushes ,  mops ,  spic and span ,  the works . 
wait .  wait a minute . 
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing . 
she &apos;s asian .  they don &apos;t have jews in asia .

i &apos;m talking about dna samples ,  fiber optics ,  search parties ,  they got infrared scanners ,  fbi scientists .  they figure this shit out .  they always figure it out . 
i won &apos;t do it . 
you and i have done nothing .  you especially .  we are innocent . 
i got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull ,  mike tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack .  .  . 
money ? 
what are you talking about ? 
what ? 
no i don &apos;t . 
your investment ideas never work out . 
but not tonight . 
where do you look ?  what side of the neck ? 
he &apos;s right . 
we need padded chairs . 
oh ,  jesus .  .  . call the police . 
all right people .  new plan .  not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan . 
that is a load of shit .  personal power has nothing to do with any of this .  tony robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly ,  yes ,  but to give him credit for this ,  for all of this .  .  . well that &apos;s just more than the man deserves . 
micheal ,  now is probably not the best time for this . 
he &apos;s cracked up . 
boyd .  .  . what have we done ? 
regarding what ? 
okay .  here &apos;s the deal and it &apos;s a good one .  lois is cool .  it &apos;s a pacified situation . 
that it was all an accident .  she wants to hear it from micheal &apos;s mouth . 
you care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation ? 
blood money .  insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all .  in no way have you mentioned that money .  and i find that to be very very offensive . 
nope . 
then what do they have ? 
there &apos;s my point exactly . 
a little gut check time fellas .  a time for some serious self - exploration .  how do i function ?  for real ?  no more bullshit .  can i keep my cool when they bounce my bananas ?  when they won &apos;t play my fucking song ?  etc ,  etc .  do you get me ?  do you get me ? 
okay micheal ,  let &apos;s go .   upsy daisy big guy . 
are we supposed to ? 
these rings represent the commitment fisher and liz make to each other on the day .  fisher do you take liz to be your beloved wife ,  to respect ,  honor and cherish till death do you part ? 
why can &apos;t we do it through the mail ? 
what else have you forgot ? 
i &apos;m sorry .  i &apos;m sorry i forgot the tent .  i don &apos;t think i forgot anything else . 
it &apos;s a bachelor party .  you sort of have to do it before the wedding . 
he &apos;s my friend .  he &apos;s not a moron . 
why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality ? 
i just don &apos;t see him in the big picture . 
i &apos;m not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body . 
how much ? 
well ,  the night is young .  did you straighten out the chair situation ? 
that &apos;s sweet . 
yeah .  nesting . 
hello . 
you fucked a prostitute ? 
no buts .  i told you your friends were jackasses . 
like if something happened to him ,  he could still get us . 
so what do we do ? 
no .  .  . 
i could have done it better .  i &apos;m a fucking ball - buster i am . 
i &apos;m just so scared of that song .  that fucking ,   &quot; my son just arrived the other day .  .  . he says thanks for the ball ,  come on let &apos;s play .  i got lots of bills come again next day .  he &apos;s grown up just like me .  .  . my boy is just like me .  &quot;  gordon fucking lightfoot ,  cat stevens ,  whoever ,  that song just fucking kills me . 
everything okay ? 
that &apos;s just insecurity . 
i &apos;ll take a ride . 
dear god .  .  . i don &apos;t know how to pray . 
if i was to think .  .  . if i were to think .  .  .  no i mean i have thinked it over .  .  . i have .  and without putting a lot of pressure on you i just .  .  . well i just .  .  . 
the first day . 
pup corn ? 
that &apos;s a good one . 
we don &apos;t think so .  i mean ,  we just want the singing when i come out . 
 .  .  . we will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours ,  no matter how low ,  how vile .  .  . 
smart .  smart .  smart .  think big picture ,  take your time .  i wish i had .

it was you ,  wasn &apos;t it ? 
she &apos;s some of your finest work ,  daryl . 
not much .  he was just a computer program .  nothing more .

sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next . 
don &apos;t get out of the car . 
we know you didn &apos;t kill those guards . 
you &apos;re not capable of it . 
sid 6 . 7 isn &apos;t grimes .

i can &apos;t believe that &apos;s your mother .  we &apos;re talking babe - a - licious chub fest ,  right here in the 501 &apos;s . 
so far away ?  in xenia ? 
a couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he &apos;s seen . 
naked girls ,  wild sex ,  video games .  no wonder it &apos;s called  &quot; heaven .  &quot; 
never say never . 
every one of these women thinks she should be the next angel of the month .  it &apos;s your job ,  ted ,  to decide which of them is right . 
not bad for a hack .  he has a future in yellow journalism . 
you go first . 
and i was wondering . 
hi ,  teddy bear . 
sweetheart ,  what is it ? 
ted ,  we put a lot of love in our business . 
we think you should give up the magazine .  sell it .  let someone else run it .  whatever it takes . 
we understand your disappointment ,  teddy .  christy is a pretty ,  sexy ,  provocative ,  voluptuous .  .  .   we .  .  . uh .  .  . we understand your disappointment . 
there ya go .  always remember ,  focus on the peach .  .  . 
but those are our dreams ,  son .  we have to make them come true . 
i - i don &apos;t have the keys . 
you do know how to drive ?

who exactly are you ? 
this is humiliating .  we &apos;re being ejected from a prom ! 
you &apos;re on the next plane home . 
they &apos;re not my parents ,  helen .  my parents are back in xenia and i hurt them very much . 
how are the hometown folks treating you ,  back in xenia ? 
impressive .  this is bigger than our whole house . 
better view ,  more spacious ,  new carpet .  it &apos;s a no - brainer . 
i didn &apos;t know they gave them for best lip gloss retention during a blow job . 
just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago . 
what do you want from me ?  i &apos;m trying to be fair .  but i can &apos;t keep you on staff if you turn every pta meeting into an agent orange cover up . 
me ? 
i guess . 
why can &apos;t you be nice to me ? 
wow .  .  . you clean up nice . 
where are we going ? 
now it makes sense ,  the whole neo bohemian ,  down with hypocrisy ,  fight the power crap .  you &apos;re a poor little rich girl . 
it &apos;s all so complicated . 
i see . 
just a few tokens of my affection .  i &apos;ll be back soon ,  don &apos;t worry . 
but who would run the store ? 
everything i am is because of you .  can you ever forgive me ? 
i like you ,  ted .  you know that .  i liked you before you were filthy rich . 
that &apos;s a good start ,  yes .  a very good start . 
a lot ?  i mean ,  a whole lot ? 
the parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy .  which is seldom . 
we don &apos;t allow tipn ,  ted . 
there you are ,  ted - baby .  everything all right ? 
you ready for your big coming out party ?  everybody &apos;s dying to meet you . 
i told you you could do it .

i was thinking ,  antigua ,  maybe . 
ray .   stop calling .   i told you the dental records will take time .  .  . 
wasn &apos;t enough van ryan had to destroy the people who invested here .   he got to be old ,  he and his rich cronies would come down here ,  hunt and whore ,  act like assholes .   one trip he showed up with this young girl he &apos;d picked up somewhere ,  gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp .   that came with her . 
no .   i &apos;ve done it a couple of times ,  i mean with guys i dated .   but this hurt .  .  .  like ,  he was built .  .  .  you know .  .  . 
did you try to fight him ? 
how long ? 
kelly &apos;s file .   read it .   you &apos;re going to find an angry ,  sexually confused girl who &apos;s made threats on her mother &apos;s life and a female lover she &apos;d never identify . 
where &apos;d you come up with this stuff ,  anyway ? 
which she might have saved ,  if she hadn &apos;t set out to destroy the man &apos;s life . 
i &apos;m gonna take you back to the office .  will you put out a call on suzie &apos;s car for me ? 
that bothers you ? 
no . 
at that point were you able to fight him off ? 
why ? 
not that stuff about her running away ,  him trying to find her .   that &apos;s bullshit . 
you guess ?   did he or didn &apos;t he ? 
and then what .  .  .  he touched you ?   did you maybe flirt a little .  .  . 
he pushed into me .  .  .  i couldn &apos;t stop him .  .  .  it hurt . 
a ride .   you want one ? 
yeah ,  sometimes .   lots of the kids hang out here .   you really think something bad happened to suzie ? 
excuse me ? 
get off my property . 
jesus .   well ,  i do too ,  sometimes .  .  .

where &apos;s the hose ?   we can set up . 
the only way we &apos;re gonna blow this now ,  is if we do it ourselves .  .  . 
shit .   i was afraid of that .   she left this garbled message on my machine .   can you calm her down ? 
no !   christ .   listen ,  kelly ,  i &apos;m counting on you .   you calm her down .  i mean do whatever you have to ,  whatever it takes .  .  . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  kelly .   i &apos;m sorry it had to happen like this .   she was losing it .  .  . 
i &apos;m running away . 
good thinking . 
nellie gail ranch .  .  . 
you &apos;ll get over it .  we &apos;ve got a knockdown ,  airtight ,  motherfucker of a lawsuit against sandra van ryan . 
who is it ? 
meet my partner ,  gloria perez . 
is that what you think ?   you have friends ?   is that what they told you ? 
like i said ,  i hadn &apos;t really expected to use it .   anyway ,  i &apos;m going through a drawer .   i hear a car .   i look out the window .   i see nicole driving away .   i leave my room ,  and there &apos;s kelly . 
but you do admit to touching her ,  to putting your arm around her .   isn &apos;t that against the rules ? 
yeah ,  well ,  you fixed that .   what the hell happened ,  anyway ? 
jesus ,  man .  .  .  you okay ? 
but i .  . 
i can &apos;t ,  sandy .   i &apos;ve got to run .

i dont want to be safe ! 
i understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end . 
what are you talking about ? 
how dare you !   how dare you !  that animal !  ?   that monster !  ?  he disgusts me !  you disgust me !   so he knew where to hurt you ,  is that it ?  you had a sling on your arm at the funeral !  i didnt have to sleep with you to find that out .

you &apos;re perceptive too .  i forgot to add that to the list of surprises .  i &apos;m with the national security agency .  and unlikely as it may sound ,  i need your help .

thomas edison knew how to make the light bulb .   he had the energy source .  he had the vacuum .   but he didn &apos;t have the filament .   he tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power . 
it appears as though magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings .  and he is using adamantium as its core .

oh ,  delbruck ,  delbruck .   was will dien tachlas von dir ? 
good night . 
surely he kept his notes  -  -  his private papers and records in some other place ? 
isn &apos;t it true that darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until ,  by some extraordinary means ,  it actually began to move with voluntary motion ? 
but wasn &apos;t that the whole basis of your grandfathers work ,  sir .  .  .  ?  the re - animation of component parts ? 
you have more chance of re - animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system , 
incidentally  -  -  i don &apos;t mean to embarrass you in any way ,  but i &apos;m a rather brilliant surgeon .   perhaps i can help you with that hump . 
it seems that way .   you didn &apos;t hear any music at all ? 
what is this place ? 
what a filthy job ! 
do you have the name i wrote down ? 
i &apos;m getting excited just thinking about it .   what if he &apos;s not there ? 
it &apos;s always been one of my favorite names . 
it &apos;s not enough .   more !   more ,  do you hear me ? 
oh ,  do you like it ?   i &apos;m not partial to desserts ,  but this is excellent . 
what &apos;s the point of my setup ?  it &apos;s not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said . 
where is he ? 
bring  -  -  me  -  -  the  -  -  violin ! 
you don &apos;t understand ,  master .  the big fellow &apos;s broken in and kidnapped your fiancee . 
no !   the only hope now is to get him back here .   if i can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum .  .  . 
come on ,  big fellow !
