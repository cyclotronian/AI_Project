thanks . 
yeah ,  yeah it is ,  howard .  and here i was thinking i could tell you something you didn &apos;t know .

tell me about it . 
freak ,  schmeek .  most of us are freaks in one way or another .  try being born a male russian countess into a white middle class baptist family in mississippi and you &apos;ll see what i mean . 
you still need the rope ?  i thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins . 
it was like .  .  .  nothing was there .  .  .  and then justin appeared and the core .  .  .  became metal .  .  . 
it &apos;s against my better judgement ,  but i &apos;ll run this by the man downstairs .  you &apos;ll know my decision by the end of the day . 
since the initial transmission ,  there &apos;s been no further contact .  just the beacon ,  every two minutes . 
i thought of that ,  with the filters from the clark ,  we &apos;ve got enough breathable air for twenty hours .  after that ,  we &apos;d better be on our way home . 
dr .  weir ,  what &apos;s this the door to ? 
yes ,  we can see some kind of mist .  what is that ?

30 hours to neptune orbit .

you look like an eighties rock band . 
i &apos;ll be watching over you . 
the shields on the station should protect us . 
at this rate ,  the infection should be complete in two ,  maybe three weeks  -  - 
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to calculate .  and it &apos;s not rubber .  it &apos;s muscle ,  tendon .  i seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to  -  - 
uh ,  victor ,  i hope i haven &apos;t done something to make you think .  .  . 
everyone wants to know where lisa is .  how should i know where lisa is ?   what am i gonna do ?  now my little sister goes to the same high school .  the party &apos;s over .   so who do you have first period ?

knock it off ,  damone .  i need real help . 
school .   school is no problem .  all you have to do is go to get the grades .  and if you know something ,  all you have to do is go about half the time . 
hey ,  slow down .  this is my brother &apos;s car . 
like ,  you know ,  giving blow jobs . 
was it great ? 
i didn &apos;t ask for any help .  did you ,  linda ? 
what do you think it is ? 
of course it was damone .  if it was ron johnson ,  you &apos;d be out to here ! 
you didn &apos;t tell me that they can be so nice ,  so great .  .  .  but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they &apos;re five years old .

dad ,  too .  i sold the house .  i &apos;m a faceless sinner ,  harry .  .  . 
have you reported to your probation officer as directed ? 
well ,  they needed immediate answers ,  frances .  it &apos;s good manners and good sense .  you shouldn &apos;t be bothering yourself with these right now . 
 .  .  . i &apos;m sorry to keep you waiting ,  the staff review ran over .  did you enjoy your mother &apos;s visit ? 
you &apos;re an outcast .

it &apos;s hardly been used at all .  i got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years .  swear to god .  that &apos;s like new . 
okay ,  i &apos;ll kill you when you change ,  i swear to god in jesus christ &apos;s name . 
swear to god ,  on the bible ,  you won &apos;t try to escape and you &apos;ll get us across the border . 
i don &apos;t have the slightest idea . 
it &apos;s the bitterest of pills .

not even for lunch ? 
you know what you look like ? 
so she picks the women ,  we pick the programs .   seals ? 
well ,  flea ,  i appreciate the respect you just showed me .   but i don &apos;t need it and don &apos;t want it  -  -  not that kind of respect ,  anyway .   it &apos;s just gonna hurt us both ,  okay ? 
sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth .   but i &apos;m trying to be honest ,  okay ?   three years is a long time .   don &apos;t ask me to predict how i &apos;ll feel then ,  jordan ,  because i don &apos;t know .   and either do you .

gentlemen ,  let me get to the point ,  i can &apos;t see the wisdom of pursuing this old court - martial against general arnold . 
 &apos;charming little victories ?  &apos; please don &apos;t expect much more of us ,  monsieur .

we need to narrow this down somehow .  .  .  we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests . 
aren &apos;t you going to get that ? 
what do we have here ,  margaret ? 
seymour ? 
starting now ,  we attack them . 
silliest thing i ever heard of -  why in the world should we go through all that ? 
it &apos;s certainly the best chance they &apos;ve had to kill you . 
why do you laugh ?  -  you don &apos;t believe she taught me ? 
time is running out ,  dana .   soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine  -  -  and vigo &apos;s .   well ,  mainly vigo &apos;s .   but we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship .

you may laugh .  caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you ,  but to me  -  -  they mean a great deal .  you see ,  i &apos;m ill and all of a sudden i got a fear of missing life .  i don &apos;t want to miss life  -  -  do you understand ? 
good evening ,  mr .  kringelein  -  -  where &apos;s the baron ? 
i don &apos;t see why it &apos;s unusual for a stenographer to be pretty  -  -  if she does her work well ,   -  -  seems so silly .  i don &apos;t know why they don &apos;t like girls like me in offices .  personally ,  i hate offices  -  -  i &apos;d much rather be in the movies . 
is that mrs .  preysing . 
yes . 
madam has slept well ? 
you may go ,  mr .  kringelein . 
how much  -  -  how much do you want  -  -  you need money  -  -  you have nothing .

i can &apos;t .  i just left home . 
well ,  no ,  roy .  your mother found you . 
alright ,  i was wrong .   there is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster .

this house is sacred to him .   it &apos;s the source of his memories  -  -  his rage .   mrs .  strode ,  i beg you .   don &apos;t let your family suffer the same fast as laurie and her daughter . 
god ,  what &apos;s wrong with him ? 
runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in northern europe thousands of years ago .   they were symbols  -  -  carved out of stone or pieces of wood .   of all the runes ,  thorn had the most negative influence .  cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic .

sometimes a cigar is just a cigar .

possibly . 
walt disney ,  who gave us snow white and the seven dwarfs ,  plays shuffleboard .   jesus christ plays shuffleboard .

i &apos;m sorry .   but two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for the reader ,  weren &apos;t you ? 
i know i can &apos;t speak now because laura &apos;s father died ,  and i just have to take it because otherwise i &apos;m a bad guy ,  with the emphasis on guy ,  self - centered .   well ,  i &apos;m fucking not ,  not all the time ,  anyway ,  i &apos;m really sorry jo .   but you know ,  liz .  .  .  i can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself .   and maybe you think i should ,  but it &apos;s not much of a life ,  you know ? 
the conformist . 
uh ,  yes i ,  like ,  do .  .  .  it &apos;s simple .  you make the tracks  -  -  recording studio  -  -  deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut ,  the master is then dubbed to submasters ,  which are the  &quot; mothers ,  &quot;  as their called ,  for each press in the plant .  you press the cd &apos;s or records ,  put in your cover art ,  and that &apos;s it .

your back ,  it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle ? 
three days you &apos;ve laid there .  it &apos;s time you ate . 
it will take less effort as you learn . 
tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have .   all else is just marking time .   you &apos;re marking time . 
what &apos;s the point !   you have me ,  finish it ! 
the resemblance is amazing . 
i can &apos;t imagine who did it .  i can &apos;t think of any enemies i have .

kings and sixes . 
they &apos;re very simple .  i believe in the golden rule .  i &apos;m not the first man to die for preaching it .  but if they would only listen to it  -  -  we could have a fine ,  decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things . 
they &apos;re newspaper men ,  mollie .  they can &apos;t help themselves .  the lord made them that way . 
the city sealer &apos;s office !

this is way too fucked up for words . 
fuck ,  go to the car .  .  .  call for backup .  tell  &apos;em officer down . 
i &apos;m sure there &apos;s a logical explanation . 
i guess not . 
tell him ,  harold . 
i know .  and that &apos;s great .  but it would be great in a better way ,  not a better way but a different way ,  if i could find him and bring him back . 
no .  this is the end of the road .  there &apos;s a dead human being here .  for all of his faults ,  he was a human being ,  and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody . 
i like you so much ,  with or without hair .   but don &apos;t spread that around .  bad for business . 
darling ,  did you bring the insect repellent lotion ? 
oh ,  and the sun block ? 
what spf ,  sweetie ? 
because ,  you know ,  you seem so distant .  and you work late every night .  and we hardly ever have sex ,  and when we do ,  it &apos;s .  .  .  i don &apos;t know .  it feels different . 
oh ,  baby .  i &apos;m sorry .  can &apos;t you hire somebody else ?

let me tell you another  &quot; bedtime story ,  &quot;  doctor jones .  after the grail was entrusted to joseph of arimathaea ,  it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three knights of the first crusade .  three brothers ,  to be exact . 
elsa .  elsa don &apos;t .  elsa .  elsa .  give me your other hand ,  honey .  i can &apos;t hold you .

she ransacked her own room and i fell for it .  how did you know she was a nazi ? 
how did you she was a nazi ? 
this is intolerable ! 
dad ! 
junior ,  give me your other hand !  i can &apos;t hold on !  ! 
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s nothing .  just rumors .   what was it they claimed was stolen ? 
there were five stones in the beginning .  over the centuries they were dispersed by wars ,  sold off by thieves like you .  .  . 
no .  they are here  -  -  somewhere .  a century ago when the british raided this temple and butchered my people ,  a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs . 
i like the service here . 
and then they took their children . 
yes ,  stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae . 
try me . 
i &apos;m reporting you to the  .  .  .  .  . transit authority !  !  ! 
don &apos;t do it .   don &apos;t aim at the head . 
door &apos;s locked . 
anything .  .  . a feeling .  .  . a smell .  .  ?

al ,  are you doing anything in there ? 
you got a better idea ,  you tell me .  other than her ,  there &apos;s no one here i know . 
yeah .  .  . you &apos;ve fallen for her . 
holy .  .  . 
what happened ? 
don &apos;t do it ! 
 .  .  . and sort of .  .  . disinterest . 
but i don &apos;t listen .  .  . then i &apos;d be crazy . 
who do you work for ? 
if gruner led us away ,  who &apos;d he lead us away from ? 
what did you tell them ? 
now what ? 
yes . 
just ran into two of your  &quot; geologists .  &quot;  geologists whose hands aren &apos;t all chewed up .  .  .  ? 
when &apos;s your deadline ? 
 &quot; tortious interference &quot;  ?  sounds like a disease caught by a radio . 
cbs does not do that .  and ,  you &apos;re questioning our journalistic integrity ?  ! 
you are a fanatic .  an anarchist .  you know that ?  if we can &apos;t have a whole show ,  then i want half a show rather than no show .  but oh ,  no ,  not you .  you won &apos;t be satisfied unless you &apos;re putting the company at risk ! 
a gun ?  yes . 
if this holds up ,  and it very well may not ,  mike .  .  .  but ,  if it did .  and we aired this segment ?  and cbs was sued by brown & williamson ?  i think we could be at grave risk . 
hey ,  lowell . 
oh ,  someone took a poll ?   &quot; are all things canadian boring .  .  .  ?  &quot; 
lowell ! 
i believe that ?  yes ,  i believe that . 
no ! 
you &apos;re vulnerable . 
these are yours . 
i &apos;ll have the tournedos of beef .  and the lady will have the same ?   i assume you &apos;re a carnivore . 
no kidding .  i &apos;ll bet you have some very grateful clients .  what &apos;d rex buy you ? 
hmmm .  .  . 
friends ? 
arty farty stuff .   lithographs and pre castro cubans .  watches and mileage on private jets .  stuff ,  miles .  stuff you get from grateful clients . 
it &apos;s a no go ,  joe . 
he told me to  -  -  he said he wanted me to  -  - 
my client has ruled that out . 
what &apos;s kirshner ? 
hi ,  sweetie . 
i sold some drawers and socks ,  too; i &apos;m throwing those in . 
personally ,  i think it &apos;s stupid !   but go ahead .  have a good time .  as long as ellie doesn &apos;t object . 
what for ? 
i never thought of that . 
where &apos;s the bus to new york ? 
what do you reckon that &apos;s for ? 
huh ? 
if this is oswald ,  it must be our third oswald . 
all this blubbering over that sonofabitch !   they &apos;re grieving like they knew the man .   it makes me want to puke . 
well ,  it &apos;s a terrific yard ,  chief ,  but the man &apos;s an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss . 
if i &apos;m so far from the truth ,  why is the fbi bugging our offices ?   why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered ?   why are federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before ? 
no particular reason .   just to go somewhere . 
oh yes ,  well ,  come to think of it ,  they &apos;re right .   we got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them .   but you couldn &apos;t approach them .   they were a wise bunch of birds . 
no ,  because there were others .   there were admirals . 
he kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots .   he was getting hot under the collar ,  and telling the woman not to write when he wanted . 
you realize the things you &apos;re saying ,  willie ,  are going to be attacked by a lot of different people . 
the key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other ,  and it takes a minimum 2 . 3 seconds to recycle this thing .   the other problem is there was a tree right there .  .  .   blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the zapruder film . 
when kennedy gets to the kill zone ,  it &apos;s a turkey shoot . 
you know who the mayor was ? 
they &apos;ve been enlarged and show a lot of detail .  .  .

years ago ,  in la ,  i turned a trick on sunset and western .  the guy was polite and didn &apos;t argue about the price .  he parked his car and i took him to a house that i had an arrangement with .  a fat mexican woman was watching a tv and i told him to give her the twenty for the room .  there were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room .  the room had a bed and a dresser .  he lay on his back on the bed and i put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then i eased on to him .  about twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up .  i felt kind of guilty because he hadn &apos;t come and i offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes ,  but he said it was all right and began dressing .  when we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and .  .  .  hugged me and kissed me on the cheek .  he gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car .  i remember being relieved that i wouldn &apos;t have to work again that evening . 
maybe it &apos;s time i moved to a hotel . 
but it &apos;s a top three school  -  -

i never intended to test you two to that extent ,  but you both came through .  i should &apos;ve been informed there was a flag on the play ,  but i &apos;ll take that up with ruiz .  i made a few calls back east .  those punks weren &apos;t tied in with anyone .  as for the welshman ,  he wasn &apos;t in on it .  he was just plain dumb .  as for you ,  ricky ,  your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van . 
sombitch and i ain &apos;t never been to beantown . 
as jesus was .  jesus was also a hebrew . 
she know ? 
you is something ,  homeboy .  my trouble is  -  -  i ain &apos;t had enough stuff yet ,  i ain &apos;t et all the ribs i want and i sure ain &apos;t had enough white tail yet . 
head nigger in charge ? 
you have no interest in making things easy ,  do you ? 
 &#93 senor ? ]
 &#93 what is his name ? ]
 &#93 what money ? ]
were you provided with a gun ? 
it hurts . 
you think too much ? 
look .  maybe this isn &apos;t going to work .  maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone .  .  .  more sociable . 
he was doing his job ,  protecting the girl .  if police were involved ,  you figure it out .  i &apos;m here for him . 
none of your business .  or mine for that matter .  i got nothing more to say . 
we gotta whole pot inna kitchen .  we give you a plate - a your own . 
we gotta postcard from my son nickie and his bride .  they &apos;re inna big hotel in florida on their honeymoon .  everything is very nice . 
who ? 
oh ,  that &apos;s a sad story .  and her husband is that little fellow ,  works in peter reeves . 
oh ,  she &apos;s coming ,  eh ,  ma ? 
hello ,  ma ,  waddaya say ,  it &apos;s getting a little late . 
when you gonna get married ,  marty ?  you should be ashamed of yourself .  all your brothers and sisters ,  they all younger than you ,  they married and they got children .  i just saw your mother inna fruit shop ,  and she says to me ,   &quot; hey ,  you know a nice girl for my boy marty ?  &quot;  watsa matter with you ?  that &apos;s no way .  now you get married . 
i just wanna thank you people again ,  because the situation was just becoming impossible . 
aunt theresa ,  we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you &apos;re very lonely ,  see ?  and wouldn &apos;t she come and keep you company ,  because that way ,  you see .  .  . 
is there any reason why we shouldn &apos;t know the name of it ? 
i don &apos;t believe it &apos;s right for you to involve a boy who &apos;s not seventeen years old yet .  .  . 
don &apos;t try to get it far down .  kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son - ofa - bitch . 
i think i &apos;ve seen this nut somewhere .   haven &apos;t i ? 
might make kind of a social issue ,  not having any other negro officer . 
there &apos;s this native broad works in the laundry .  i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve noticed . 
well ,  would you like to know who it was you were marrying ? 
oh !  oh ,  it &apos;s beautiful ,  d .  b .  welli don &apos;t quite know what to say  .   .   . 
thinks it &apos;s terrific .  says for us to go the limit .  wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state . 
how many is that ,  six ?  pretty hungry ,  weren &apos;t you ? 
hey ,  do you know something ?  she supports a mother and two kids .  what do you know about that ? 
and when they get you ,  you got no more chance than a road - rabbit . 
well ,  i don &apos;t get it . 
now ,  hold on a minute ,  young man !  hold on !  that &apos;s rather big talk !  i started the john doe clubs with my money and i &apos;ll decide whether or not they &apos;re being properly used ! 
what do you mean ,  too bad ? 
no shit !  he &apos;s good ! 
what ?  ! 
don &apos;t go reading my lips ,  man .  that &apos;s an intrusion .  save that shit for the sniper school .  comprende ? 
you could say something like ,    &quot; tell me what the scumbag &apos;s name is .  maybe we can work something out .  &quot; 
the 6 horse is still last . 
mccall ,  you all right ? 
not for you ,  ray .  for me .  a close friend of mine was killed this week .  the way i figure it ,  i stop you from doin &apos; what you said ,  i &apos;m one up on body count . 
that a new picture ? 
the chief says to tell you how sorry he is .  he knew sam baffert was a good man . 
your life that bad ? 
it &apos;s all here .  .  . 
the new world . 
where you plugged - in from ? 
one condition . 
christoph was in charge of designing building modules . 
we can &apos;t break free ! 
it &apos;s far too dangerous .   zordon would never allow it . 
simon says .  .  . 
what you &apos;re sayin &apos; makes a lotta sense .  ya know ,  if i keep on killin &apos; people like i have ,  i won &apos;t have no more friends left ! 
are you frightened ? 
up down .  down up .  it &apos;s the same .  you see things through both eyes . 
what do you mean ? 
a lot of shit came out of me in the hospital .  i &apos;m sorry you got hit by it . 
i &apos;m gonna lose you ,  charlie . 
charlie ,  i &apos;m from the old country ,  and these american ways get me sometimes confused .  you tellin &apos; us you refuse the title of boss of all the bosses ? 
we can get the war started tomorrow ,  but it won &apos;t be pretty . 
this business is about taking risks . 
boss ,  i got all the time you need . 
when ya got all that blood workin &apos; in your belly ,  it ain &apos;t upstairs where it needs to be . 
tell me ,  my son .  why did you go with giuseppe ?  he &apos;s not our kind . 
tell it to the calabrian .  tell it to the jews . 
bring order out of chaos .  if you lead .  .  .  they &apos;ll follow . 
i &apos;m a hard guy .  i done more jobs than alla you combined .  and i never said no .  not once .  but dammit i don &apos;t understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends ! 
yeah ,  i know  -  picasso .  guernica< / u> ,  right ?  that &apos;s what everybody says  -  although personally ,  i don &apos;t see the resemblance .  what are you drinking ? 
i was ,  uh ,  just getting ready to leave .  .  . 
it is new .  why wouldn &apos;t it be new ? 
i &apos;ll take your hat into the cloak room . 
no ,  not yet ,  senator paine -  - not hide nor hair of the man .  you mean to say the boys haven &apos;t -  -  ? 
diz ,  you &apos;re a swell playmate -  - but -  -  .  maybe if i saw you once with your hair combed ,  or something -  - or -  - no ,  no -  - i don &apos;t think even that would do it -  - 
are you ready for him ,  bill ? 
one minute !  just one minute ! 
yes !  he &apos;s about to blow the whole machine to smithereens -  - and *you with it* ,  mr .  governor ! 
now -  - now -  - please -  - that &apos;s quite all right .  relax ,  boys -  - 
where were you ? 
my dear senator ,  have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a bill passed ? 
a *day* ! 
i &apos;ve got more .  you better tell me . 
no .  that night -  - i -  - well ,  *you* know -  -  i was pretty -  -  .  no -  - diz is a -  - a sort of brother ,  that &apos;s all -  - 
what !  who ? 
i wouldn &apos;t wait if i were you . 
that won &apos;t work ,  chick .  this boy &apos;s honest ,  not stupid . 
what are you driving at ?  you want *me* to get him to sign that ? 
why ,  you own it ,  longfellow . 
oh ,  thank you ! 
tell me more about yourself . 
have you seen the papers ? 
now ,  what do you see ? 
what &apos;s bothering you ,  huh ? 
he &apos;s not home ,  i tell you ! 
i can &apos;t find him . 
brookfield just came in . 
why are they ganging up against me ? 
you can go out there if you like .  .  . 
now hold on ,  i didn &apos;t say i didn &apos;t want to come  -  - 
that &apos;s a lot of people all at once . 
how long you been in this town ? 
it &apos;s a country club .  don &apos;t worry about it . 
you were actually at hamunaptra ? 
got guts ,  lady . 
and then one day ,  he didn &apos;t come home .  the police said it was an accident .  but cargo containers don &apos;t just fall on people .  he was murdered .  .  .  after that i fell apart .  i dropped out of school ,  became a mud wrestler ,  married and divorced a jerk .  when my mother died i hit bottom .  .  .  but then ,  when i was cleaning out her attic ,  i found my father &apos;s old bowling bag and costume ,  almost like he &apos;d left them there for me .  .  .  and i knew what i had to do . 
casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him .  .  .  and there wasn &apos;t a thing that we could do about it . 
he &apos;s turned into a completely normal person ! 
so you &apos;re only invisible .  .  .  to yourself ? 
my dear caulaincourt ,  agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live .   napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure england but ,  before that ,  he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live .   he cannot expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring england to her knees  -  -  and i &apos;m afraid that is what it has come to . 
the point i was trying to make is that i think it is reasonable to say that your majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure ,  if he decided to make peace with the emperor ,  at least at this time . 
these are odds of 8 to 1 . 
was the trip normal in every respect ? 
then ,  you have my thanks ,  captain charles ,  for safely escorting madame bonaparte to milan ,  and you may consider your assignment completed . 
good heavens ,  ambassador  -  -  what has happened ? 
no .  .  .  i have a .  .  .  room .  .  .  at the hotel de perrin . 
oh .  .  .  i see .   i understand .   how is .  .  .  the emperor ? 
i believe you sent for me . 
well ,  he didn &apos;t give it to me ,  and when i ask you to do something for me ,  return the work to me ,  not to berthier . 
yes . 
i hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is ,  sire .  my impression of alexander is that he is moody and impressionable ,  capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments .   he is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity .   you have dazzled him ,  and you have performed a diplomatic miracle ,  but alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear . 
yeah ,  you gotta have a little money to live out here ,  craig .   i never thought i &apos;d be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs .   but as soon as i got my check ,  i was gone .   paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house . 
i don &apos;t know ,  i think i passed out or something .   i don &apos;t remember . 
we didn &apos;t come here for day - day . 
must be nice .   i wish we won the lottery .  come up on a million dollars like ya &apos;ll . 
pinky &apos;s records and disc in the shopping center .   i &apos;mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you .    &apos;cause you been unemployed for a long time now ,  craig . 
i didn &apos;t think you smoked bud that much . 
you want us to give you a ride ? 
18 - years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing .   i still can &apos;t figure that one out . 
no ,  give me my damn money back .   right now ,  and i don &apos;t have no damn receipt neither . 
yoooo ,  that &apos;s it .   you ain &apos;t as dumb as i think you are ,  roach . 
when ?   after you get all drunk and loaded ? 
huh ? 
pay attention ,  mr .  watson .  pay attention and your daughter won &apos;t be hurt . 
yes ,  yes ,  i understand . 
please .  .  . 
look at  &apos;em .  he &apos;d do anything for her .  - 
what do you figure he done with it ? 
here they come . 
draggin &apos; the name of the lord through the evil mud of his soul ! 
she tarried around the kitchen after i &apos;d gone up ,  and when i went downstairs to see what was wrong .  .  . 
you ,  pearl .  you swear too . 
now listen to me ,  pearl .  you and me is runnin &apos; off tonight . 
what do you figure to do ? 
it &apos;s the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now  -  -  not to beget more . 
what happens if they don &apos;t do that ? 
what !  ? 
who ?  who did that ? 
where you think you &apos;re going ? 
your father the cop .  that &apos;s a good one .   forget fred krueger .  you don &apos;t want to know ,  believe me . 
what you dream ? 
what is it ,  ninotchka ? 
can you blame them ?  .  .  .  at least the may day parade is over . 
i am comrade buljanoff . 
you &apos;re looking magnificent ,  leon .  .  .    .  .  . isn &apos;t he ,  general savitzky ? 
is this satisfactory ? 
that &apos;s two weeks from thursday .  .  . 
listen ,  i want to be absolutely frank with you .  i have no business in moscow . 
is this what you call the  &quot; butler &quot;  ? 
that is why i believe in the future of my country . 
i have never heard one . 
i don &apos;t look too foolish ? 
you see i couldn &apos;t shout that . 
from what i read i thought champagne was a strong drink .  it &apos;s very delicate .  do people ever get drunk on this ? 
and we won &apos;t stretch up our arms .  .  . 
your highness ,  forgive this intrusion ,  but .  .  . 
sir ,  i still don &apos;t think ,  uh ,  we can contain it anymore .   there &apos;s a cancer on the presidency .   and it &apos;s growing .  with every day that  .  .  . 
eight words back in  &apos;72  -  -   &quot; i covered up .   i was wrong .   i &apos;m sorry &quot;   -  -  and the american public would &apos;ve forgiven him .   but we never opened our mouths ,  john .   we failed him . 
excuse me  .  .  .  are you talking about recognizing china ,  mr .  president ?  that would cost us our strongest support . 
 &quot; victory at sea ,  &quot;  al  .  .  .  henry .   the pacific theatre .   christ ,  you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks . 
mr .  president ! 
we really must go ,  mr .  president . 
what &apos;d he say ? 
so ,  what &apos;s this about ,  dick ? 
 .  .  .  and now i have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway  &apos;cross town to go to school with some nigger kids .  i think ,  mr .  president ,  you &apos;re forgetting who put you where you are . 
you &apos;re too modest ,  nixon .   you &apos;re as evil as i am .   we &apos;re both from poor families .   but others pay to feed the hunger in us .   in my case ,  millions of reactionaries .   in your case ,  millions of vietnamese . 
we can prosecute the new york times ,  go for an injunction  .  .  . 
he looked old ,  didn &apos;t he ? 
yes ! 
what would you a done if he &apos;d been released ? 
that &apos;s the boy . 
 .  .  . i love you more &apos;n more ,  ever day . 
 .  .  . how &apos;d you sleep ? 
did you go up to his trailer ? 
you tell me the option . 
hey ,  sheriff .  how &apos;s everything ? 
you should get the order you want . 
you wanna see if he has more shells ,  go ahead .  i say we wait .  .  . 
betty ,  honey ,  listen to me .  a man came by from mutual life insurance .  he says you &apos;ve got money comin &apos; to you from del &apos;s policy .   del &apos;s life insurance policy  -  -  are you with me ? 
your lines are in the script ,  but you can ad lib . 
i have .  .  .  did it sound that bad ? 
what are those for ? 
this isn &apos;t fair ,  you know .  do you always get what you want ? 
could you give us an example ? 
we can live with that . 
i said  &apos;got it ?  &apos;
you &apos;ve got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone .  that &apos;s not our betty .  .  . 
i see .   did chloe testify ? 
how &apos;d he know about the treasure ? 
mcgill .  no ,  the marriage &apos;ll take place as planned . 
so i borrowed it till i did know ! 
an &apos; all my meals for free .  .  . 
itta bena ,  now ,  uh ,  that would be .  .  . 
now what can i do you for ,  mister french ? 
holy - moly .  these boys &apos;re a hit ! 
who gave you this idea ? 
back east in newport ,  rhode island ,  they call  &apos;em the fall river debs .  in pensacola ,  the mobile debs .  in norfolk  -  - 
are you laughing at me ,  dick - brain ? 
i &apos;m busy ,  mayo .  it &apos;ll have to wait . 
i know . 
yes i do ! 
you what ? 
the kid on the windy side of the baker &apos;s window .  that &apos;s how he put it . 
jets . 
yes . 
unless daddy comes back later . 
478 .  .  . 
yeah .  .  .  sounds like the constitution to me .  with a little of the bill of rights thrown in .  .  . 
god damn .  .  .  kid never had a chance .  .  . 
i want it duly noted ,  that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the oakland police department .  the fbi doesn &apos;t have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations ,  my friend .  as i &apos;ve said before ,  agent rodgers ,  we have things under control in our city .  .  . 
i saw .  .  .  but .  .  . 
you better just kill me tyrone .  and when huey gets out ,  when oakland &apos;s just wall to wall junkies ,  you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got .  i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll be real happy about that . 
we &apos;ll all get out of here together . 
you are familiar with how these things are done .   in fact ,  i would like to claim aggrieved status . 
colonel tarleton ,  you deal with these damned rebels . 
tarleton has a list of our men ,  most are on it .   a regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list ,  burning them ,  killing whomever resists ,  women and children ,  as well . 
father ,  i saw a post rider at the house . 
do you know what this place is ,  ellie ?  oh ,  i know you know it &apos;s a boneyard ,  but a bone ain &apos;t nothing and even a whole pile of  &apos;em don &apos;t amount to much .  do you know what a graveyard really is ? 
was it pascow ? 
out of the mouths of babes ,  louis . 
your father - in - law packs a wallop ,  for an old guy .  he and his wife gone back to chicago ? 
you &apos;ll be fine ,  ellie .  now you can be excused .  go and wash your face . 
i &apos;ll watch my back . 
and how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that ?   a family heirloom ,  perhaps ? 
has it changed since the last time you were here ? 
oh ,  there &apos;s a hard tale ,  jack .  most of the decent pirates in town won &apos;t sail with you  -  -  seem to think you &apos;re a jinx . 
say again ? 
how do we expect to find an island no one can find  -  -  with a compass that doesn &apos;t work ? 
sir ,  i &apos;ll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise . 
what &apos;s your name ? 
because you &apos;re a pirate . 
but i survived .   and i still have that single shot .   it &apos;s meant for one man .   my mutinous first mate -  - 
what &apos;s that ? 
on what ? 
you can &apos;t mean that . 
icky !   what &apos;s happening ? 
there &apos;s a guard outside my door !  i &apos;m a prisoner ,  nigel !   do you understand that ? 
really ?   what have you been doing ? 
the problem is the by - product created by the process . 
susan ! 
just like old times . 
god ,  when we were in that store all i could think about was that one time ,  when we were in school ,  and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal .   do you remember that ? 
yeah ,  i have something i &apos;ve been meaning to give you . 
mrs .  argon ?   it &apos;s sim . 
what do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat ? 
think of the fun we can have  -  we &apos;ll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet &apos;s ford .  how &apos;s that ? 
this is something i should have done a long time ago ,  only i didn &apos;t have sense enough to do it .  no ,  i had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that i knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning .  but no more .  no more !  so that &apos;s that . 
you should have known better than to write ,  romeo .  i found that out a long time ago . 
this way . 
what do you want ? 
it &apos;s all right .  you can write your own ticket .  a hundred and fifty bucks a week . 
is that so ? 
i was sent from the post in place of our social editor . 
oh sure ,  we &apos;ll be happy .  what &apos;s the matter with your eyes ? 
no ,  no .  strange ,  i &apos;ve never seen anne act that way before .   it &apos;s funny i never thought to tell her you were a girl ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
now ,  we &apos;ve got it right up to where the boy &apos;s wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters  -  how &apos;s that ? 
i don &apos;t eat waffles . 
yes . 
now ,  now jeeves .  &#93 5] was that nice ?  was that being a gentleman ,  jeeves ?  was it ,  jeeves ?  your name is jeeves ,  isn &apos;t it ? 
what ? 
thank you . 
 &quot; changes .  &quot;   and it &apos;s not just the fire or big stuff like that .  it &apos;s little things .   did you hear about bill miller ? 
i &apos;ve worn some kinky stuff before  .  .  . 
gone out with you .  she woulda like rearranged your tonsils . 
hi . 
say -  - why don &apos;t you take this remote instead .  it &apos;s got a little more  &quot; ooomph &quot;  in it . 
look  .  .  . 
you know what i really like ? 
it &apos;s extension 215 if you want to try me back . 
yes . 
yes i can &apos;t .  .  .  . i don &apos;t make enough money to be able to do that . 
come on ,  i thought we had fun ,  rich boy  -  - 
hello ? 
hi . 
 -  -  the promotion says :  buy any 10 healthy choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1 , 000 for purchases made with a special coupon .  so in the supermarket ,  you notice their products ,  first you notice they have a teriyaki chicken dinner at $1 . 79  -  that &apos;s a pretty good deal .  .  .  . but then i noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can .  .  .  .  . and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it &apos;s a really amazing deal because i stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup .  now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label .  that &apos;s those little bar codes ,  you know ?  the universal product codes ? 
i don &apos;t know . 
i don &apos;t ,  no matter what my sisters say ,  ok ? 
hi ,  is this your first time calling ? 
they need to see the new 484 &apos;s to make sure it works with their oc .  .  .  . 
you &apos;ve been to his quarters ,  haven &apos;t you ? 
charenton has changed; it &apos;s not safe for you here . 
it needn &apos;t be; not if you &apos;ve another story . 
the journal was pretty harsh to roosevelt today . 
sorry to disappoint . 
all men love .  but men like hearst  -  -  they don &apos;t bother with convention because -  - 
it &apos;s good ,  huh ? 
they came to me with an offer .  800 , 000 for the negative and all the prints . 
it was the best ,  kid
say what you &apos;re gonna say . 
just keep your eye on the ball . 
i can &apos;t find my ball . 
in other words ,  you &apos;re not interested in him but you &apos;d be interested in somebody else ,  right ?

try to understand ,  vickie .  jake &apos;s got a lotta aggravation .  he &apos;s been a top contender too long . 
of course ,  it &apos;s normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope . 
i can hear myself starting out .   &quot; your honor  -  -  i have a friend who &apos;s an amateur sleuth ,  an one night ,  after a heavy supper  -  -  &quot;   he &apos;d throw the new york state penal code right in my face .   -  -  and it &apos;s six volumes . 
now stop wasting time ,  thorwald ,  or i &apos;ll hang up and call the police .

he was the only one i wasn &apos;t a hundred percent on .  i should have my fucking head examined for goin &apos; forward when i wasn &apos;t a hundred percent .  but he seemed like a good kid ,  and i was impatient and greedy and all the things that fuck you up .

our kind of women ? 
but you eat ,  don &apos;t you ? 
there was only three of them at first .  i guess i lost my head . 
suppose that lednov was to have found you ,  instead of me .  why you wouldn &apos;t have had a chance . 
of course i do  -  -  but it &apos;d be better for you  -  -  and the house is kind of small  -  - 
that something i shouldn &apos;t see ? 
i figure we &apos;ll get along just fine . 
until you came along we were going to sonora . 
for the last ten miles i &apos;ve been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up .  i &apos;m getting to the point where i don &apos;t think there &apos;s any place named sonora . 
what are we gonna do ?  i &apos;m cold .  i can &apos;t move ,  i &apos;m so cold .

is it true they &apos;re all midgets with big heads ? 
why are you being so defensive ? 
lot of good stuff .   got the new bien nacido .  want a taste ? 
you know what ?  let &apos;s take the santa rosa turnoff and hit sanford first .

hi ,  guys .  we should probably get going . 
what &apos;s the matter ? 
 .  .  . tell morgan to play games  -  -  it &apos;s okay to be silly . 
is anything missing ? 
some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world .   nothing really bad is going to happen ,  is it uncle merrill ? 
i &apos;m just meeting a guy here and moving on .  so far i haven &apos;t been able to find him . 
shame about the kid .  seems a lively sort .

is this a fair mix ? 
viktor ,  it &apos;s my studio . 
simone ? 
well ,  no one could accuse you of being over - exposed ,  simone .   why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight ? 
nudity has just never been an issue for me ,  frank .   for me ,  clothes are just an option . 
and still the connection was undeniable .   i haven &apos;t read  &quot; eternity forever &quot;  but i know it &apos;s brilliant .   and i know i would be perfect for clive . 
dad ,  you know i don &apos;t like to get between you and mom but she &apos;s feeling down right now .   she broke up with kent .

mr .  sayer ,  did we pay the million bucks yet ? 
good morning ,  simone . 
that isn &apos;t magic . 
i work at an insurance place and at penny &apos;s ,  so cole can go to that good school . 
the ancient aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was .

just the man who &apos;s gonna see you driven to your knees !  sheriff buell clayton from texas . 
mississippi &apos;s the other way ! 
 -  -  actually ,  my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named ramblin &apos; bobby holt .  when i turned twenty -  one ,  i went to europe with visions of being free and independent .  my luck ,  he was on the plane .  i landed in paris and fell in love before i could claim my baggage .   we were together for almost a year .  i thought he was it . 
they should arrest people for obeying the speed limit . 
why are we doing this ? 
oh . 
maybe he &apos;s that good .  never been caught ,  no criminal record . 
it &apos;s the last place they &apos;d look . 
lil &apos; cagey ,  y &apos;know ,  don &apos;t like t &apos;share trade secrets ,  that type &apos;a thing . 
girl one of these fools has an fbi badge on him !  is this the one that was doing the inspection ? 
you &apos;re being tricked .   sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors .   he &apos;s figured out they &apos;re made of subatomic particles called neutrinos ,  and he &apos;s going to create a negative neutrino field .   twenty four hours a day ,  until they &apos;re back on earth . 
perhaps it did . 
when did this happen ? 
i like that too . 
who have you been talking to ? 
do you want to stay here ? 
we thought you &apos;d be alone .   we want to talk about .  .  . 
people think i &apos;m stepping out on neil .   we &apos;re causing quite a scandal . 
i shouldn &apos;t have listened to you ,  i should &apos;ve followed you right into the  &quot; can &quot;  the way he did . 
okay ? 
she took you shopping for a tie ? 
i &apos;d like you to switch to the day shift ,  mike .   to be home for dinner .  helen insists that t . j .  be home for dinner .  .  .  that &apos;s why he &apos;s on the morning shift . 
are you in charge here ? 
you should &apos;a brought the girl . 
how do you know where the gun is ? 
shooting . 
you &apos;re so responsible it &apos;s disgusting .  but you &apos;re my only friend .  .  .  do you hate me ? 
how are you doing ,  kid ? 
lieutenant ,  i &apos;ve triangulated recent bizarre events -  -  the bronx ,  jersey ,  brooklyn -  -  all rippling out from -  -   here .   the e . s . u .  science center .  octavius &apos; experiment seems to have opened a hole in space - time ,  drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding ,  electromagnetism and gravity -  - 
yeah ,  roz . 
in this obsolete little cyclotron ,  i &apos;m solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th century .   with more power ,  i could -  - 
that nobel prize will just have to wait . 
a bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory ,  the big bang ,  kaluza - klein -  - 
jawohl ! 
wisecrackers ?  where did he pick up his english ?  in a pretzel factory ? 
good morning ,  animal !  what &apos;ll it be for breakfast ?  scrambled eggs with little sausages ?  bacon and eggs sunny -  side up ?  griddle cakes ?  a waffle ? 
grable ,  not gable ! 
you &apos;re crying ,  animal . 
 .  .  . a lieutenant james dunbar ?

los ,  los .  dummkopf ! 
you &apos;ll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you . 
who did ? 
you off your rocker ? 
nun ?  was ist ?  haben sie &apos;s herausgefunden ? 
you should go and see the doctor .  maybe i can  -  -   silk stockings ? 
wunderbar !  maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife .  but there is a piano teacher in the village  -  - 
you &apos;d better talk ,  schulz ,  because i &apos;m going to find out with you or without you .  because i won &apos;t let go for a second .  because they &apos;ll have to kill me to stop me .  so talk ! 
you heard him . 
give me a list of those effects .  i want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed ,  no matter how insignificant . 
oh
oh ,  i forgot to tell you .  while you were unconscious ,  i injected a nano - probe into your bloodstream .  it &apos;s been navigating your cardiovascular system ,  and right now i &apos;ve attached it to your left ventricle .   a little trick i picked up from the borg . 
there is something else ,  captain .  one of the scientists ,  a doctor soran , has insisted on speaking with you .   i told him you were busy ,  sir ,  but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away . 
nothing on my scanner ,  sir . 
captain ,  please  -  -  we &apos;ll take the risk .  we &apos;ve got< / u> to find out what it is .  .  . 
my readings indicate great instability . 
steady .  .  .  steady .  .  .  all right ,  mr .  scott . 
mr .  scott ,  all power to the weapons systems  -  - 
give me what i want  -  -  and i &apos;ll consider it .  .  . 
bones !  .  .  . 
my lord ,  enemy commander wishes a truce to confer . 
we &apos;ll be going to warp speed  -  - 
mr .  scott on discrete . 
have they proceeded with their experiments ? 
that &apos;s it ? 
sporadic energy readings port side ,  aft .  could be an impulse turn . 
you mean i have to die to discuss your insights on death ? 
he &apos;s just going to hang around the bushes while we eat ? 
aye ,  sir .  descending . 
10 , 000 m . s . l .  ,  admiral . 
no .  .  .  i want to stay with you .  .  . 
you either need a new uniform or a new neck . 
 &apos;his nose should pant and his lip should curl .  .  .  &apos;
i believe the boy is .  .  .  afraid .  .  .  of me . 
how many ? 
one .  it &apos;s ru &apos;afo . 
both .   i think i &apos;m having a mid - life crisis .  .  . 
you are the guiding intelligence behind the borg .  .  .  ? 
but now .  .  .  they are all one with the borg . 
where ? 
captain ,  the enterprise ! 
you seem to have an answer for everything . 
you will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo .  .  .  and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation .   there &apos;s only one torpedo left .  .  . 
mr .  president . 
what kind of creature is this ?  last night you two were spooning  - 
retire . 
course heading ,  captain ? 
when whoever it is makes their move ,  you won &apos;t be here to ask if he &apos;s the one . 
how could you vouch for me ?  that &apos;s .  .  .    .  .  .  arrogant presumption  - 
can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness ?   would that constitute a joke ? 
in nineteenth century france ,  workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines ,  flung their wooden shoes  -  called sabots  -  into the gears to stop them .  hence the word sabotage . 
and this makes you  &quot; sad &quot;  ? 
that &apos;s what i don &apos;t get  -  -  it &apos;s mostly basic stellar cartography :  star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations .  it &apos;s not even restricted material . 
geordi ,  put 211 power to the engines .   take it from life support if you have to  -  -  everything you can give me . 
 believe me ,  we don &apos;t under -  stand it either .  you &apos;re the closest ship so i want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say .  get the lay of the land ,  if the empire becomes unstable ,  it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant . 
and when i was ready they were going to replace you with me ,  an exact biological duplicate .  put a romulan agent at the heart of starfleet to . influence your command structure .  it was a bold plan . 
our greater goal is more important ,  brother . 
credit card . 
we &apos;re only going to be here a few hours .  .  . 
hey ,  that sounds interesting .  you like it ? 
do you have children ? 
we &apos;re going .  .  .  damn !   we &apos;ll tell the press that there was an accident .  chemical warfare spill .  that cover cannot be violated in any way .  understand me ,  shermin ? 
houston found it in the extraterrestrial &apos;s suit . 
you can change a directive ,  george .  you &apos;ve done it before .  listen to me .  he &apos;s going somewhere in death valley .  lathrop wells was never anything but a bus stop .  east is the nuclear site .  there are no roads in there .  she was teaching him to hitchhike .  i &apos;m telling you .  we block the four roads into death valley and we got him . 
i am husband ? 
no ,  no .  .  .  don &apos;t say that .  bad word .

what ? 
hello .  .  .  hello .  how are you this morning ? 
no ,  they don &apos;t talk .  .  .  we talk to them . 
the cowboys were right .  you can make money fast gambling . 
you won ten dollars .  big deal .  if we don &apos;t get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship . 
the yellow one . 
why wouldn &apos;t he want to go through the roadblock ?  .  .  .  what did you guys do ?  .  .  .  i won &apos;t tell anybody . 
i made my choice ,  lenny .

he doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .  leave him alone . 
hey ,  you going to watch or you going to do ? 
faith ,  call me ,  okay ? 
how did it happen ?   what was iris doing riding around with jeriko wearing a wire ? 
so finally he gives iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do . 
come on ,  amigo ,  the world &apos;s full of marks .   and nobody knows how to work  &apos;em like you do ,  pal .   you could sell a goddamn rat &apos;s asshole for a wedding ring !   let me buy you a drink . 
sounds like tick &apos;s already celebrating . 
he &apos;s been cooked - off

how did you hook up with faith ? 
but i mean isn &apos;t he faith &apos;s new -  -  
oh jesus ,  sheriff ,  i am sorry .  i meant to call you  -  -  i got distracted  -  -  the sumpter girl was not one of speck &apos;s victims .  that &apos;s the good news . 
oh yes ,  i see .  you must get asked this a lot .

how do you send out an apb on a dead man ? 
we &apos;ll wait .  get online with low ,  inform him of zero &apos;s route  -  -  we &apos;ll set a trap for him .

i can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for  -  -    -  -  800 , 000 years perhaps .   don &apos;t keep me in suspense .   what year ? 
nothing to do ,  i &apos;m afraid .   i &apos;m just a librarian after all .   wasn &apos;t exactly made for all this swashbuckling .   very byronic end ,  though .   i appreciate that .   do you know byron ? 
what &apos;s your name ? 
and centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again ,  we couldn &apos;t .   our adaptation was too successful .   we survived .  .  .  we endured .  .  .  for this .

my mary  -  -  she &apos;s not in japan ,  she &apos;s single ,  and she &apos;s got no rugrats .  she does have a little gambling problem ,  she plays the football cards a bit too much ,  but she &apos;s a babe ,  a surgeon babe !

here ,  just have one of these then . 
mary ah ,  forget it . 
okay ,  tell you what :  i &apos;ll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from japan .

jesus christ ,  o &apos;donnell ,  you &apos;re the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution . 
my specialists are in agreement :  this morning &apos;s letter is not khruschev .  last night &apos;s letter was .   the evidence supports only one conclusion :  there has been a coup ,  and khruschev was replaced overnight .

folks come to alaska for a real short list of reasons :   money .  adventure .   solitude .   those cover most everyone .   but frontiers also draw another type of man .   one with a demon in his gut .   he comes to the edge of the world to face that demon ,  and lay it to rest .

i &apos;m sure ,  simon ,  they did something real off for you to feel this way .  .  .  but when it comes to your partners  -  -  or your kid  -  -  things will always be off for you unless you set it straight .  maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance . 
nothing like no choice to make you feel at home . 
we held each other .  it was better than sex .  what i need he gave me great . 
how could you do that ?  he &apos;ll hurt him .

you lilly - livered bleeding hearts ! 
breakfast beetle ?   beetle ?   beetle fruit ?   fruit bat ?   fruit battle ?  volkswagen ?   fruit wagon ? 
i feel like we &apos;ve been at war ,  charles . 
lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon . 
 &apos;i &apos; will tell you what is boring .   once you cover up the wallpaper ,  knock down a few walls ,  alter the traffic patterns ,  and  -  -  perhaps  -  -  only perhaps  -  -  think about an inground pool  -  -  the place might< / u> just be livable .   what &apos;s on the third floor ? 
an attorney ?

i &apos;ll be all right ,  chauncey you go ahead with mrs .  aubrey .  .  . 
good ,  sir .  and so ,  it seems ,  did the president  -  but we would like to have some facts; such as ,  uh .  .  .  what exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the first american financial corporation ?

good morning ,  louise . 
 .  .  .  i see . 
 .  .  .  we shall need some proof of your having resided here ,  mr .  chance . 
why &apos;d you do it ,  craig ? 
did you know that eskimos have not one ,  but fifty words for snow .  it &apos;s because they have so much of it . 
it was lovely being you being malkovich ,  my dear .  i &apos;d never seen the passionate side of sweet maxine before ,  or her actual tits for that matter .  if only ,  i &apos;ve been thinking to myself ,  if only i could actually feel what malkovich feels ,  rather than just see what he sees .  .  .  and then ,  dare i say it ,  if only i could control his arms ,  his legs ,  his pelvis ,  and make them do my bidding . 
maybe this is what you &apos;ve always been ,  craig ,  you just never faced it before . 
moving story . 
no ,  a sexy dream .  of course ,  a scary dream . 
i think it might &apos;ve been this lotte woman talking through me .  maxine likes to call me lotte . 
never heard of it . 
yes .  how did you know it was me ? 
well ,  we &apos;ll have all the money in malkovich &apos;s bank account ,  plus he still gets acting work occasionally . 
good - bye ,  maxine . 
you saying whitefolks won .  that what you saying ? 
you hurt me . 
tell me something ,  stamp .  tell me this one thing .  how much is a nigger supposed to take ? 
they range up to three thousand .

papers .   just papers .   you know ,  my papers .   business papers . 
well -  - sure ,  i could do that -  -

what the fuck are you -  - 
well ?   aren &apos;t you ? 
put me down ,  you son of a bitch ! 
you &apos;ve been training two years to take me out .   here i am ,  the big ,  bad vampire hunter .   so do it . 
why do you hate us so much ? 
i agree .   we play along for now ,  we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks . 
where were you ,  whistler ? 
so that &apos;s down and dirty .   got anything to say for yourself ? 
get in .  youre leaving . 
looks like we hit pay - dirt .  this place is crawling with them .   see the valets over there ?  they &apos;re vampires .  so is the doorman . 
so many of them  -  -  i still can &apos;t believe they &apos;re real . 
what happened to the power ? 
 -  - and if she ever did -  - 
yeah ,  so ? 
i think we get the gist . 
and let it be known -  - before we even get to burkittsville -  - it &apos;s gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie -  - for half the cost -  - 
no fucking . 
she would &apos;ve had to have a key ,  anyway ,  to lock the deadbolt behind her . 
well ,  she &apos;s got to be somewhere< / u> here . 
someone want to tell me what &apos;s going on -  - 
the four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands ,  don &apos;t you ? 
what ? 
why ? 
 .  .  . ray ? 
 .  .  . just doin &apos; my job . 
because of your information i alerted internal affairs to check out detective gordon .   i had to keep on with him as if nothing was different .   he slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid frank &apos;s place . 
no .  but you &apos;re in very big trouble . 
come on .  you brought it up .  do you know anything ? 
it &apos;s crazy and dangerous .  my god .  i shouldn &apos;t have told you . 
shoot . 
you didn &apos;t tell him about me ? 
it &apos;s good to see you . 
what ,  and miss all the fun ?   c &apos;mon ,  not a chance .   so ,  what &apos;s the verdict ? 
if you don &apos;t mind me asking ,  what is the reason you are in this place ? 
i thought you said we were roommates .  that we should talk about everything . 
thirty - six hours .   i can &apos;t believe it .  everything is gone in thirty - six hours . 
jesus fucking christ ,  diego .   i ain &apos;t telling you .   it &apos;s just business .   now ,  shut up .   you &apos;re driving me crazy . 
it &apos;s oregano .   you got ripped off ,  pal .  what are you gonna do with all this ? 
listen ,  americano ,  it is very nice to meet you ,  but maybe we are going too fast .   you take a little and then come back . 
this is bullshit ,  george .   we &apos;re never going to find anything down there . 
i can &apos;t believe we &apos;re stealing a plane . 
it is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism ,  one passes to insurrection  .  .  .  as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war ,  the latter being the determining factor  .  .  . 
in indochina ,  they< / u> won . 
what  &quot; group &quot;  ? 
let &apos;s suppose you were a spy .  in prison ,  when the nlf contacts you ,  you pretend to support the revolution ,  and then the french help you to escape  .  .  . 
even that could be a trick .  you escape ,  then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you ,  and so you are able to contact me  .  .  . 
it &apos;s better to split up ,  to increase our chances .  we must change hiding places ,  and change them continually  .  .  .  in the meantime ,  we must make new contacts ,  replace our arrested brothers ,  reorganize our sections -  - 
it &apos;s good nobody is following us  .  .  . 
what do you think of the strike ,  ali ? 
your honor ,  this is a tape from miss lawson &apos;s answering machine .   i would like to play it now .

she was . 
dr .  wong  -  -  what type of medicine do you practice ?

hi ,  joe .

michael doesn &apos;t understand .  people who make the kind of money my brother makes don &apos;t carry money on them .  they keep it all in various accounts . 
my jewish friend &apos;s grandmother did . 
this won &apos;t take long .  i &apos;m shooting tomorrow morning .  i just need to do some prep work . 
about a year and a half . 
he &apos;s very .  .  .  clean .

i just feel like i &apos;m getting a little  .  .  .  out of control that &apos;s all .  it &apos;s kind of frightening . 
what were you like when you were younger ? 
where you going ? 
 &quot; i had forgotten this .  i had somehow remembered it being more his fault ,  his decision .  then i remembered we made love in that field before we left for home .  and i remembered it was my idea .  i remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body ,  hoping he would kidnap me .  i had forgotten that too .  and i wondered ,  as i sat there .  .  .  how many other things i &apos;d forgotten .  &quot; 
is this hell ? 
gotta be an in - ey and gotta be smooth .  if it &apos;s ragged ,  it was picked too soon .  won &apos;t ever be ripe .   second ,  it &apos;s got to have just a little give ,  here .   at the edges .   and last ,  but not very far from least .  .  .   you gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood ,  looooong sniff .

i did not get the wrong man .  i got the right man .  the wrong man was delivered to me as the right man !  i accepted him ,  on trust ,  as the right man .  was i wrong ?  anyway ,  to add to the confusion ,  he died on us .  which ,  had he been the right man ,  he wouldn &apos;t have done . 
there are some real bastards in this department who don &apos;t mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette ,  but thank god there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication .  we &apos;ve got the upper hand for the moment ,  but they &apos;re waiting for us to slip up ,  and a little slip -  up like this is just the chance they &apos;re looking for .

sorry .  look ,  you sue me ,  your husband dies ,  you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato ,  and all of it quicker than wind from a duck &apos;s ass .  excuse me .  then you ask me to lie to the police . 
that dam is a con job . 
would you mind if we took a stroll on our own ? 
but alfredo ,  what you &apos;re saying is horrifying ! 
no particular reason .  .  .   nice day ,  huh ?  
see how pretty the house is ?  we did everything over .   if it hadn &apos;t been for you !   come ,  i have a surprise .  .  .  .   you must be tired .  if you want to rest ,  there &apos;s time before the funeral . 
that &apos;s fine ,  mr .  kane . 
 &quot; miss susan alexander ,  a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur  -    -  last night opened the new chicago opera house in a performance of  -  of  -  &quot;   i can &apos;t pronounce that name ,  mr .  kane . 
would you sing for me ? 
you &apos;re talking an incredible amount of nonsense ,  susan .   whatever i do  -   i do  -  because i love you . 
you &apos;ll never have another chance to hit me again .   i never knew till this minute  - 
no ,  i don &apos;t ,  mr .  kane . 
there are the people of the united states ,  and they are blaming you  -  oh ,  i know it doesn &apos;t make any sense ,  but at least you can learn a lesson from it . 
i &apos;m drunk . 
brief marriage !   ten years !  
i know ,  but  - 
i did a lot of singing after that .  i sang for charlie  -   i sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour  -  the teachers got that ,  i didn &apos;t  - 
he was in love with me .   but he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us  -  and he lost the election and that norton woman divorced him . 
in case you &apos;ve never heard of how i lost all my money  -  and it was plenty ,  believe me  - 
it &apos;s not what you think . 
you don &apos;t have anything to do with it . 
wait a second ?  who was working here today ? 
i work in a shitty video store .  i want to go to a good video store so i can rent a good movie . 
you open ? 
the quest isn &apos;t going well ? 
did you ever notice all the prices end in nine ?  damn ,  that &apos;s eerie . 
it &apos;s not really anyone per se ,  it &apos;s more of separate groupings . 
you hate people . 
that &apos;s stretching it .  you &apos;re not being asked to slay children or anything . 
this life ? 
caitlin bree .  yeah ? 
did you say caitlin bree ? 
you &apos;re trusting . 
you &apos;ve slept with twelve different girls ? 
what the fuck did you do that for ? 
check this out ,  he &apos;s from russia . 
hal &apos;s signalling he &apos;s ok . 
jessie ,  jessie ,  copy ? 
if he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can ,  they &apos;ll never make it down .   he needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks . 
that &apos;s not the issue here ,  those people are .   he can &apos;t do it alone . 
i know you don &apos;t want to be responsible for anybody &apos;s life anymore ,  but walk away and you are responsible .   please gabe ,  he went up the west ridge .   if you go up the south face ,  you can catch him ,  no problem -  - 
frank !   no ,  frank !   frank ! 
what &apos;s your names ? 
on top of the peak . 
get off my back ,  qualen ! 
i don &apos;t trust him . 
you &apos;re absolutely right ,  sir . 
i realise all that ,  missus ,  and i &apos;m very grateful to all concerned . 
it &apos;s quite simple really .  were just going to show you some films . 
good .  it wa your fault .  .  .  you sold me a crummy watch .  i want my money back . 
fucking hell .  .  . 
you must take your chance boy .  the choice has been all yours . 
annie .  .  . it &apos;s max . 
get outta here !   you and louis ? 
i picked up a tail . 
uh ,  let &apos;s go to .  .  .   hello .  .  .  ? 
you know ,  this is the cleanest cab i &apos;ve ever been in .   this your regular ride ? 
let &apos;s go . 
don &apos;t be .   i never saw him after i was 15 .   went into the military early .   so all this talk about  &quot; my job &apos;s temporary ,  i got big plans ,  &quot;  it &apos;s all bullshit . 
in case he asks . 
sure .   and the two of  &apos;em used my legs for a wishbone .   nearly snapped me in half . 
yeah .  .  .   would you ,  i mean ,  could you love me then ?   if i was normal .   maybe ? 
now what ? 
here &apos;s a fresh one .   why you ?  your colleague mr .  wilson says jerry won &apos;t speak to anyone else .  that seems oddly possessive behavior to me . 
ah ,  your psychotic is here . 
there &apos;s no plug to pull . 
i &apos;m sorry ,  miss arroway ,  not only is it too speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation ,  at this point in your career it &apos;d be tantamount to suicide . 
 .  .  .  i don &apos;t understand it .   all i can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn &apos;t accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design . 
why did you contact us ? 
page after page of data  -  -  over sixty - three thousand in all ,  if i &apos;m not mistaken .  .  .  and at the end of each .  .  . 
that &apos;s not doubt .   that &apos;s four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct .   i always wondered what you religious types did with your free time . 
i don &apos;t have any proof ,  palmer . 
it &apos;s not enough ,  don &apos;t you understand ?   i know it happened  -  -  but by every standard of science ,  by every standard i &apos;ve lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point .   it may be true but it doesn &apos;t matter because i can &apos;t prove it &apos;s real . 
i guess i &apos;d say i trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of ,  thanks for the advice ,  but no thanks .   but to dilute or censor the truth ,  for whatever reason  -  - 
i &apos;m leavin &apos; the place to john . 
a salesman !  cool hand luke a salesman ?

mom .  .  . 
this time .  what about next time ? 
what &apos;s that mean ?  ! 
then we establish how wheeler &apos;s boys recruited you after law school .  .  . 
miguel has not been infected .  as i said ,  we weren &apos;t aware of aids ,  then ,  or how it is spread . 
by the time i was fired ,  there were four lesions on my face ,  much bigger .  .  . 
whoa ,  whoa ,  whoa ,  whoa .  .  .  do you think .  .  .   ?  you think i &apos;m< / u> .  .  .    .  .  .  gay ?

taylor ,  i &apos;d rather you  - 
 &apos;then how do you account for me ?  , 
i want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner . 
thats a lie ! 
sustained . 
you may well call it upside down ,  since you occupy its lowest level .  and deservedly .   the eastern desert has never been explored  -  -  because we &apos;ve always assumed that no life can exist there .   save yourself ,  taylor .  tell me  -  -  is there another jungle beyond the forbidden zone ? 
twelve hundred years ago . 
why ?  from the first ,  i &apos;ve terrified you ,  doctor .  and in spite of every sign that i &apos;m an intelligent being who means no harm ,  you continue to hate and fear me .  why ? 
are you going to take her with you ? 
don babytalk him man .  cocksucker fell asleep .  they walked right up on us ,  he don do shit . 
come on man ! 
whatcha doing in the underworld taylor ? 
they might think i was running away from something . 
we walked right passed him .  he &apos;s following us . 
i &apos;d like a few words with you ,  in private . 
so much less refined than frizzling them in the chair . 
other people always know so much more than we know -  - so much more than they &apos;re willing to tell us . 
she &apos;s just a girl i met on the train .  you don &apos;t mind do you ? 
i &apos;ve always been a heel .  i guess i always will be . 
did he ?   i left school and worked for the labour party .   my older brother ,  george ,  had just been killed in greece ,  and he &apos;d been an active member .   i hero - worshipped him .   he was 25 years old  .  .  .   it was an exciting time for us ,  those first couple of years after the war .   we thought the country was about to become a true democracy .   i can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time .   they feel betrayed .   they want to know what went wrong . 
why ,  is there a new foreign secretary ?   who was the old one anyway ? 
and some of that .   sorry . 
good . 
you don &apos;t trust me .

can we talk about this ?   can you just try to calm down ? 
don &apos;t give me that .   kit gave it to you yesterday ,  cash . 
i never said he was my dearest love .  and yes ,  he will save me .  that i know . 
faithfulness he talked of ,  madam .  your enduring faithfulness .  now ,  tell me truly .  when you found out he was gone ,  did you get engaged to your prince that same hour ,  or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead ? 
we did it . 
i got married .  i didn &apos;t want to .  it all happened so fast . 
we face each other as god intended .  sportsmanlike .  no tricks ,  no weapons ,  skill against skill alone . 
oh ,  you &apos;ve a great gift for rhyme . 
hello . 
well ,  maybe i was a little bit concerned .  but that &apos;s not the same thing . 
it was ten days till the wedding .  the king still lived ,  but buttercup &apos;s nightmares were growing steadily worse . 
what ?  what ? 
form a brute squad then .  i want the thieves &apos; forest emptied before i wed . 
i don &apos;t think i &apos;m quite familiar with that phrase . 
your guess is as good as mine  -  - 
we &apos;ll wait until you &apos;re ready . 
what was i saying ? 
okay .   i &apos;m way over here .   is that better ? 
what is she gonna do here ? 
oh ,  sure .   i used to take him his hot milk and his opium .   achhh ,  those were the days .   vat good times ve had .   dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen ,  singing und dancing .   you know ,  not many people knew about it ,  but the fuhrer vas a terrific dancer . 
no .  at least i don &apos;t recall . 
no !  of all .  .  . 
no ,  m &apos;am .  i was only about to say ,  i &apos;ve sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test .  .  .  that &apos;s all . 
you should &apos;ve called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped .  you go starting private investigations ,  using people you don &apos;t even know .  .  . 
sam ,  if you owned a useless business like this motel .  .  .  one you probably couldn &apos;t even sell .  .  .   what would you need to get away ,  to start a new business ,  somewhere else ?   forty thousand dollars ? 
there must be some proof that exists right now !  something that proves he got that money away from mary .  .  .  some way ! 
i &apos;ve heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels .  they say it .  .  . 
you slept here all night ? 
norman ?  sheriff chambers .   been just fine ,  thanks .  listen ,  we got some worries here .  did you have a man stop out there tonight .  .  .   well ,  this one wouldn &apos;t be a customer ,  anyway .  a private detective ,  name of .  .  .

buddy ,  you &apos;re just a child . 
neither do i . 
i heard you talking .  hasn &apos;t rose come in ? 
a baby .  .  .  and she isn &apos;t even married . 
forgive my crudity ,  darlin &apos; .  i don &apos;t understand these deeper things the way you do . 
what &apos;s the matter with him ? 
of course she does and i must say i &apos;m puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital .  i should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill . 
when he was baby we called him  &quot; wa wa ,  &quot;  a baby name ,  you know .  you will find him a very good boy .  his brother can be bad and so can his sister ,  but waski is a very good boy .  and as you can see he &apos;s beautiful . 
are you going to get your degree soon ? 
rose ,  you &apos;re in an awful dither tonight .  what &apos;s the matter with you ,  honey ,  are you sick or something ? 
well ,  i think it &apos;s charming ,  rose .   but don &apos;t you think .  .  .  ah ,  the skirt is a little tight ? 
rose ,  that scruffy - looking man is out in the yard again . 
i don &apos;t think we ought to discuss this in front of the children . 
you see ,  rose ?  now that &apos;s the kind of dress you ought to wear . 
general jim beam ,  then . 
alright .  .  .  how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together ?   find out who  &quot; a . d .  &quot;  is .   i got a quick errand to run .

yo ,  you gonna show ,  tony ? 
nobody likes garbage  -  -  anyway ,  this girl with the dirty mouth wasn &apos;t bad lookin &apos; ,  but the guys wouldn &apos;t take her out for any serious datin &apos; . 
ya want the truth  -  -  ya got heart ,  but ya fight like an ape  -  -  the only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke  -  -  keep ya nose pretty  -  -  what &apos;s left of ya brain an &apos; retire . 
christ ,  i been beggin &apos; ya for a break until i &apos;m sick inside . 
is it true the most you &apos;ve ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars ? 
oh ,  a ladies man ,  huh ? 
being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective .   what were you looking for ,  mr .  valiant ? 
i do spy a kind of hope ,  which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent .  if ,  rather than to marry paris ,  thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself ,  then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death ,  to chide away this shame .  no warmth ,  no breath shall testify thou livest  .  each part ,  deprived of supple government ,  shall stiff and stark and cold appear ,  like death .  now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed ,  there art thou dead .  thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the capulet lie .  in the meantime ,  against thou shalt awake ,  shall romeo by my letters know our drift ,  and hither shall he come .  and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua .  take thou this vial ,  being then in bed ,  and this distilling liquor drink thou off .  i &apos;ll send my letters to thy lord post haste to mantua . 
romeo .  what &apos;s here ?  poison .  drunk all ,  and left no friendly drop to help me after .  i will kiss thy lips .  happily some poison yet doth hang on them .  thy lips are warm . 
too great oppression for a tender thing . 
do you have it ? 
and you believed me ?   but it wasn &apos;t my people who did it . 
best beer in the world ?   budweiser for me ,  thanks . 
that was a mistake ,  trying to kill you .  mikhi did it without consulting me ,  i &apos;d have never allowed it . 
here &apos;s yours . 
sit ,  sit .  .  .   would you like one ? 
they call me swede . 
where to ? 
christ ,  i smoke a pack - and - a - half a day ,  and i tell myself i could be worse .   it &apos;s just so damned pleasurable .

 &quot; drove down the highway there was a big jam the family had died there inside their minivan there was a backup it went on for miles but as bad as it was it was gone after a while &quot;   chorus here .    &quot; you may think there &apos;s nothing to it and the truth is hard to see to be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be &quot; 
you know ,  my mom has this saying . 
tim &apos;s jealous ,  you know ?  he wants to have ideas too .

 .  .  . so ,  while it &apos;s a laugh riot for the whole family ,  and tim conway is just about as funny as they come ,  especially when he goes .  .  . 
just a rehash of something that wasn &apos;t very good to begin with . 
how about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door ? 
stop it ,  artie ,  will you ?   where have you been keeping your -  self ?  i &apos;ve got the most wonderful news for you . 
he thinks it could be made into something .

could i ?   gillis ,  last year some -  body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley .   so i borrowed money from the bank so i could pay for the ranch .   this year i had to mortgage the ranch so i could keep up my life insurance so i could borrow on the insurance so i could pay my income tax .   now if dewey had been elected  - 
that woman who &apos;s after me .  she hates you .  because she knows i love you .

you &apos;re not afraid are you ? 
is this how ? 
there &apos;s something very dangerous about her .  something evil .  .  . 
can i give you a lift ? 
you better have a pretty good explanation for this ,  selena . 
lana lang .  how great to see you . 
mayonnaise ?  donald loved mayonnaise .  why would you think that was the problem .  ? 
no ,  i mean ricky .  he &apos;s not interested in any of this stuff . 
ah yes ,  august gorman .  have you looked for work this week ,  mr .  gorman ? 
that &apos;s up to the judge ,  gus .  it &apos;s not your problem anymore . 
oh ,  superman ! 
come on ,  let &apos;s give it a dry run . 
it is kinda romantic . 
wait !  don &apos;t go in !  it &apos;s a trap ! 
it &apos;s just a bad flu ,  really .  how did you know  .   .   . 
she &apos;s in california .  that &apos;s wild enough ,  i guess . 
she knows .  clever ,  very clever .   and unappreciated .  but i &apos;m going to take you away from all this . 
where &apos;s mine ?  !  where &apos;s my parachute ? 
need i ask who &apos;s favored to collect at the end of this week . 
i .  .  . uh .  .  . 
i &apos;m glad to hear that zoe &apos;s okay . 
she &apos;s in trouble ? 
it just seems .  .  . kind of weird . 
i &apos;ve tried to stay out of it .   but it turns out that &apos;s not so easy ,  sam .   you &apos;ve gone and got yourself this lawyer .   mitchell stephens .  you and risa and wendell and the ottos . 
have you been waiting long ? 
there &apos;s no such thing as an accident ,  nicole .   not in a situation like this . 
yes . 
what are you up to ,  nicole ? 
you ought to stop this nonsense ,  loretta ,  these two dollar bets . 
where are we running ?   what am i missing here ? 
and what have i done to her ,  besides not buy her a new fur coat lately ?   sidney ,  you were right  -  -  the boy &apos;s a dilly . 
i &apos;m a schoolboy  -  teach me ,  teach me . 
i got that boy coming over here .   what &apos;s so funny ? 
who put this item in about the comic ?    &quot; if there &apos;s a more hilarious funny man around than herbie temple at the palace ,  you &apos;ll have to pardon us for not catching the name .   we were too busy screaming .  &quot;  does this temple have a press agent ? 
that &apos;s your idea of logic ?   i tell the judge i didn &apos;t murder the man  -  the judge says ,   &quot; why not you ?  &quot; 
listen ,  get a good night &apos;s sleep  -  tomorrow &apos;s another day .   feeling sorry for yourself won &apos;t help . 
and i &apos;m sorry for you ,  too ,  sidney .  you &apos;re going down with the ship . 
now don &apos;t take this the wrong way ,  but you are a terminator ,  right ? 
this t - 1000 .  .  .  what happens when you shoot it ? 
on august 29th 1997 it &apos;s going to feel pretty fucking real to you ,  too !   anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day ,  get it ?

when did you get in ? 
in what capacity are you employed by this mr .  lindgren ? 
you don &apos;t believe it was a car accident . 
what did you do ?   to make them take the early 70 &apos;s away from you . 
minor officials bother you ,  don &apos;t they ? 
don &apos;t you work with ian ?

ann -  -

i have to do it .  i can &apos;t stand by and watch more things go down the drain .  you &apos;re young ,  you don &apos;t understand . 
but more or less . 
 &apos;gratulations ,  gina .  it &apos;s so goddamn wonderful . 
bert &apos;s ok ,  sure ,  he &apos;s a good man .  i won &apos;t kid you though ,  ed ,  nobody around here has any experience with this kind of ,  er .  .  .  and i hear they &apos;re bringing a prosecutor up from sacramento .  capital offense .  taking it seriously .  .  .  hmm .  .  . 
just people .  they gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money .  this is why the big lobby ,  ed .  but they put their pants on one leg at a time .  just like you and me . 
 .  .  . yeah ,  it &apos;s a tough break . 
someone broke into this room . 
this place is a maze . 
what &apos;s that ? 
look at this .   an ambyloid reovirus protein .   that explains why the computer &apos;s confused .   the plant &apos;s infected with a virus . 
none of that matters now .   the people upstairs need us .   we have to help . 
do you mean dr .  whittlesley ? 
not today .   besides ,  i think the director of the museum is expecting you . 
no .   i &apos;m all right .   i won &apos;t let this affect me anymore .   john wouldn &apos;t get help .   his ego endangered the lives of others .   his theory came first . 
where would we find it ? 
what was it ? 
give me a shot from truman &apos;s ring . 
how do< / i> you intend to explain his twenty -  two year absence ? 
what &apos;re we doing here ,  truman ? 
that &apos;s the  &quot; big guy &quot;  .   quite a paintbrush he &apos;s got . 
let me out ,  truman .   you &apos;re not right in the head .   you want to destroy yourself ,  you do it on your own ! 
how are you ,  mother ? 
special agent scully  -  -

agent mulder  -  - 
let me out .  stop the car . 
into stargher .   inside .  .  . 
ich weiss nicht . 
no . 
yes .  they said it wasn &apos;t the driver &apos;s fault .  harry often said what a careful driver he was . 
let &apos;s go away . 
i wish i knew . 
right .  sit down miss schmidt ,  we will send your letters and things back to you . 
joseph harbin &apos;s body was found in the coffin . 
please keep this passport to yourself ,  until i make some inquiries ,  will you ,  major ? 
 .  .  . a cop .  you &apos;re a real cop i suppose .

sehen sie da gleich da unter .  da unten ist est passiert .  passiert  -  english . 
no one follows that midrash . 
it &apos;s called the flame alphabet .  it &apos;s supposed to be the word of god written in fire . 
fuck you .  i hate the jews at least as much as you do . 
fifty &apos;s an exaggeration .  anyway ,  that was a different moment .  things were possible that aren &apos;t now . 
where &apos;d you get this ? 
did you kill ilio manzetti ? 
what about chicken ? 
tell it to hitler .

johana ,  am i boring you ?

that &apos;s good . 
today at lunch ,  you asked me if i had any questions . 
here .  .  .   here .  .  . 
i give you this .   you &apos;re stubborn .  .  .  dumb ,  but stubborn . 
how was your trip ? 
your mother ?  oh .  whoops . 
esther ! 
you two know each other ? 
well ,  he &apos;s kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend . 
the death card  -   - 
consuelo screamed too  -  -  and clo clo .  why did you do it ?  why ?  quick .  tell me why ? 
well ,  does everybody love us now ?  you &apos;ve been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors ! 
kiki ? 
we stood here once before . 
i hated you that day  -  you and your flip talk  -  with that little girl lying dead . 
nobody ?  huh !  .  .  .  how come ? 
by the way ,  laurence ,  were you here last time your mistresss brother came over ?  you know ,  just before he disappeared ? 
mrs de moraes must have taken it hard ,  eh ?   her brothers death . 
adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in epping forest ,  didnt he ?  seemed like a good idea .  an ex - junkie ,  obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide .  he just forgot one thing :  forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery english november .  an englishman might have thought of that ,  but a brazilian .  .  . 
and you still havent told me why you sent me after friedman . 
lombard ,  this is not a jewish name ,  is it ? 
you may not .  and besides ,  it is irrelevant . 
is it real ?   you people are sick . 
an austrian .  .  .  not much to go on ,  is it ? 
i am ready now .  .  . 
i don &apos;t understand ,  jeanne .  .  .  why did you do it ?   why ? 
but you can &apos;t just kill a man for his teeth ! 
you don &apos;t believe me anymore ? 
he already did ,  but i want god to forgive me too . 
must feel better this side of the wall . 
i &apos;m not ,  but majorek is . 
you don &apos;t want to worry about that .  my grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice .   in my opinion ,  jaundice is not very serious .  drink up . 
best we had was cat &apos;s eye in the second at del mar ,  and he was only 5 - 2 .   not many longshots comin &apos; in today . 
how  &apos;bout a handkerchief ? 
twist ,  you know this guy ? 
paltrow ,  sterling ,  furey ,  and the big alabama are in from new orleans .  fiskin and the boone kid from denver ,  and phillips ,  barnett and limehouse chappie from new york .  those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from . 
i know i give him four threes .   we can &apos;t let him get away with that . 
we bought ya a tap into moe anenberg &apos;s wire .   he &apos;s got eyes at every track in the country .   you &apos;ll get race results ,  odds ,  scratches ,  pole positions ,  everything; and just as fast as western union gets  &apos;em . 
this isn &apos;t like playin &apos; winos on the street .   you gotta do more than outrun the guy . 
he &apos;s not as tough as he &apos;d like to think . 
how ya doin &apos; ? 
hi there ,  snyder .   things a little slow down at the bunco department tonight ,  eh ?   somebody lose the dominoes ?

well ,  congratulations . 
i don &apos;t want to see people killed any more than you .   but we try to help out we die ,  and all we do is die . 
where &apos;d they go ? 
you &apos;re out of your mind . 
but that &apos;s the great thing about gold .   a little goes a long way . 
figure they don &apos;t want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them . 
i said nobody dies .   nobody dies . 
you &apos;re not losing trust ,  are you ? 
which boarder ?   saudi ?   kuwait ?   syria ?

congratulations . 
that &apos;s the truth -  - every single word ! 
i &apos;ll explain later -  - 
feel bad about ol &apos; fred .   just can &apos;t hold back when i &apos;m feelin &apos; woolly .   still ,  feel kinda bad .  but now we &apos;re square .   anyway no use for holdin &apos; a grudge .   i deserved a rap in the head .

mr .  stamper will escort you to the plane . 
harry is coming to pick me up . 
never play with someone &apos;s else &apos;s cards .  you always get a new deck .  look at this card .  see anything ? 
my mind plays tricks on me .  is it okay if i take a bath now ? 
he &apos;s going to check out heaven first .  he gets a round trip ticket to heaven .  he gets in heaven and finds it just like back home .  people dripping with sweat ,  working in the fields ,  hardly surviving .  he asked a man who was getting a drink of water ,   &quot; i thought the streets were paved with gold .  &quot;   &quot; they are but you won &apos;t see them ,  &quot;  he said .   &quot; boy ,  you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness .  &quot;  so he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell .  he sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back ,  picking their teeth .   &quot; man ,  this is a dream .  &quot;  he asked ,   &quot; what &apos;s you &apos;ll doing ?  &quot;  they all hollered back ,   &quot; sinning .  &quot;  the devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said ,   &quot; please to meet you .  &quot;  he asked ,   &quot; i thought you &apos;ll was supposed to be burning in fire .  &quot;  someone said ,   &quot; man ,  ain &apos;t no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins .  &quot;  the man was going go ask the preacher back on earth .  .  .

how are your grades ? 
you planning on going somewhere ,  eduardo ?   you don &apos;t like it here ?  this is the best situation you &apos;re going to have for a long ,  long time . 
that &apos;s good coke . 
i &apos;m trying to bust the tijuana cartel . 
let me ask you a hypothetical question :  if salazar worked for madrigal and the juaraz cartel ,  and he went out of power ,  would it mean the juarez cartel is losing influence ? 
i &apos;m looking for my daughter ,  caroline .  she comes here . 
well ,  it isn &apos;t . 
thanks ,  mark . 
it &apos;s a tightrope ,  spud ,  a fucking tightrope . 
well ,  at one time ,  you &apos;ve got it ,  and then you lose it ,  and it &apos;s gone for ever .  all walks of life :  george best ,  for example ,  had it and lost it ,  or david bowie ,  or lou reed  - 
it &apos;s the great outdoors . 
it &apos;s fresh air . 
my visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees . 
this is the starship enterprise . 
on  &quot; the planet of galactic peace ?  &quot; 
he rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors . 
what you fear is the unknown .  the people of your planet once believed their world was flat .  columbus proved it was round .  they said the sound barrier could never be broken .  it was broken .  they said warp speed could not be achieved .  the great barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear .  it &apos;s an extension of personal fear .   captain kirk ,  i so much want your understanding .  i want your respect .  are you afraid to hear me out ? 
no ,  no ,  no .  scotty  -  scotty .  .  .  there &apos;s so much i want to tell you .

you seem fine now . 
kids .   ten seconds of joy .  thirty years of misery . 
okay .   okay .   de - nail ain &apos;t just a river in egypt .   she &apos;s probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion . 
well ,  what &apos;s the point of waiting ? 
hello ? 
tell me what happened ? 
bye ,  daddy !  hope to see you again real soon . 
no way !  the whole enchilada in one shot . 
well ,  enough about the king ,  how  &apos;bout you ? 
so you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you &apos;re unloading  - 
what makes you think i could do that ? 
on their honeymoon . 
he &apos;s drugged out of his mind !   he &apos;s completely zoned out . 
san francisco ,  new orleans ,  rio de janeiro ,  rome ,  kinshasa ,  karachi ,  bangkok ,  then peking . 
no ,  i think it was always you .   it &apos;s very strange . 
my notes .   observations .   clues . 
what have you done ?   did you .  .  . kill someone ? 
what &apos;d they give you ?   thorazine ?   how much ?   learn your drugs  -  -  know your doses . 
 &quot; what about the germs ?  &quot;   i say .   he goes ,   &quot; i don &apos;t believe in germs .   germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap !  &quot;  now ,  he &apos;s crazy ,  right ?   hey ,  you believe in germs ,  don &apos;t you ? 
kathryn ,  you know he can &apos;t possibly know that .   you &apos;re a rational person .  you &apos;re a trained psychiatrist .   you know the difference between what &apos;s real and what &apos;s not . 
what virus are we talking about ,  dad ? 
i &apos;ll take a piece of that bet .  i say it doesn &apos;t come up five times each side . 
but ,  in particular ? 
that &apos;ll make five in a row .   never seen it so hot .   sometimes i don &apos;t even want to get out of bed .   i &apos;d rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze .   i was in mexico this one time -  - 
how much ? 
they look nice . 
is it pretty ? 
jake . 
lied ?   what do you mean ? 
there is no us ,  remember ? 
i got the money all packed .   i put the jeep in the garage .   figure that way people will think maybe me and jake went away .   might buy us some time . 
the police don &apos;t know that .   and it &apos;s going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck .   i &apos;ll take you as far as california .   if we can even make that .   after that i &apos;m cutting you loose . 
are you all right ? 
someone will find me . 
what should i do ? 
you ain &apos;t from oz .   oz is in that one movie . 
you &apos;re fucked . 
i think you might just want to do as i say . 
afraid of it ?   boy ,  i live in the dark .  all cause of a woman who made me this way .  people are afraid of what they can &apos;t see .  i can &apos;t see nuthin &apos; ,  so it &apos;s all the same to me .   kiss from a beautiful woman ,  kissy kissy kiss ,  a lick from a dog ,  slurp ,  slurp ,  the kiss of death  .  it &apos;s all the same to me . 
you are< / u> crazy ,  you know .  be seeing you ,  old man . 
i don &apos;t care what you believe as long as you leave me alone . 
would you ? 
you said you &apos;d cut that up with the man who did her in .
